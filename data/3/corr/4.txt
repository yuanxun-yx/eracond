HELLO, WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE?
I LOVE WATCHING GHOST HUNTERS.
I LOVE DC MOVIES.
MY FAVORITE MOVIE IS BY BATMAN.
IT IS AWESOME, VERY REALISTIC AND A PERFECT STORY.
IT'S A DIFFERENT MOVIE, THERE ARE NOT MANY SIMILAR ONES.
I LIKE A LOT OF SERIES TOO.
MY FAVORITE SERIES IS YOU.
IT'S THE SERIES ABOUT A PSYCHOPATH WHO LIKES TO HAVE GIRLFRIENDS.
IT'S FROM A DIFFERENT STORY AND THAT'S WHY I LIKE IT.
THERE ARE NOT MANY SERIES ABOUT PSYCHOPATHS, SO I LIKE IT TOO.
