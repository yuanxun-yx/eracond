Hello I went to the cinema to see the new Star Wars film.
Odd, I cannot see your answers, what could be the problem?
I really want to talk with you but it seems like you are writing something endless.
I could tell you that the last Star Wars Film is not that good as everyone is saying.
Disney has destroyed the Star Wars Universe, at least for me it is not interesting anymore. 
What do you think about it?
It is something strange. I thought may be they could do something relevant but no, the only thing that everyone is enjoying is the series. Maybe the future of this franchise is in that direction.
It is really strange that you don't answer, and this could be just my imagination trying to chat with someone that does not talk.
Maybe we should continue talking if that is possible for you, although I believe it could be a little harder. 
But I am happy to assist you to get this bot ready.
Well I have to leave now. I really enjoyed this conversation. 
Goodbye my good fellow.
I really hope you have a great day.
