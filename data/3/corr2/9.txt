Hi!
Alright? Talk to me.
Would you recommend any good movies?
I like Pulp Fiction and action movies in general. Is that you?
Yes, The Count of Monte Cristo.
Yes! Exactly.
First, the story is quite iconic, so much so that there are several movies and series and even soap operas based on the story of Monte Cristo. Nevertheless, the film has a good script, and I identify a lot with the work.
Interesting what you said! Honestly, I'd like to know a little more about this! The story itself fascinates me. It helped me in a difficult time.
The ending is captivating, yes. I agree with you. When I just want to review excerpts, I always end up prioritizing the last scenes of the film.
I particularly prefer action movies.
Like Pulp Fiction.
Thats all for now, I need to leave. It was great talking to you.
