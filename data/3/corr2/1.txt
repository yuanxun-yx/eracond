I recently watched Minutemen with my sister on Disney+.
I really like the Harry Potter Saga and recently watched the first and the second one.
My favorite movie in the saga is The Prisoner of Azkaban.
Yes, thats the one!
I think it was a great movie not only because of the acting, but also because of the beautiful scenarios and plot line.
Well, I think that's great since most of the actors were kids at the time.
For sure, I loved the ending! But also the whole aesthetic of the movie was just so beautiful!
I love comedy too! But Im a sucker for some good romance and mystery.
We have similar tastes! I also don't enjoy horror movies or even thrillers.
My favorite is Brad Pitt.
I think he gave himself to the movie.
