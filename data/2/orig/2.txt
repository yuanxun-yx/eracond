Hi, I do like movies and the genre about It
It the Thing, this horror movie is very good
I like 007 which is an action movie
I like the movie called Waters for Elephants, do you know it?
The characters are too good, but the drama that takes place in the films story is impressive.
I didnt know that, I have to know better about it, shes a great writer.
Yes, the end of the movie is good, but the scene when the animal is abused hurts me.
I love comedy movies, it makes me feel good and it still cheers me up the day.
I dont like sci-fi movies, but I have a lot of respect for those who like them.
I also like DiCaprio he is amazing, very good actor
I do not know that
No thank you.
