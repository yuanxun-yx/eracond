Yes, I do
I have a diverse mix of likes and dislikes. Mob and war movies are a sure hit with me. I believe Saving Private Ryan is my favorite.
Nightcrawler is one that I like and want to see again soon.
Yes, this one
It was suspenseful, while being grounded in reality. Good acting too.
Dude is an amazing actor. I didnt know that, but I can believe it. It helped him compose the character
That scene where he punches the mirror in the bathroom is amazing. You can see the main character psyche slipping in that moment.
War movies in general
I dont have patience for those sappy romantic movies.
I dont have one. You can bet that the movie will be good when he is in it, like De Niro ou Al Pacino, but I cant single any one out.
Cool, I didnt know that
Yes, in cinema. Nail bitting stuff
No, I did not.
Sure, go ahead
Sounds far fetched, but I would watch it if there is nothing else on.
Ok, goodbye
