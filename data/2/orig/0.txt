Oh really? Im a huge fan of movies too. I love action movies!
Last week i watched Dunkirk. I really love it! Do you watch it?
Yeah! this one. What do you think abou it?
The war scenes, the action, the photography
Thas is so cool! I think improvisation is part of the art
I love the end but for me the best part is the bunker explosion!
I like action movies. Comedy movies is not my best, some movies I like some not. I like to take a popcorn, sit and watch an action movie
I dont like romantic movies. I think they are the same, always the same ending. My girlfriend love romantic movies. So, sometimes i watch with her. But is not my first option hehe
Oh boy, Leonardo DiCaprio is mine too. He deserve more oscars i think. His acting is perfect. I like very much Titanic too.
I think he deserved, but i did not watch Wlf of Wall Street. Do you recommend it for me?
Inception is one of my favorites! I watch twice, just because the ending. I love the soundtracks. I love Time of Hans Zimmer!
This one i did not! sorry
Yes! I have to leave now! Im going to watch a movie hehe Goodbye
