Hi. I really love to watch movies.
I like The Devil Wears Prada.
I love the story, and I felt that I am similar to the actress.
I didn't know that. I think they spend a lot of money on it.
I appreciate when they went to Paris. 
I like suspense movies.
I don't like horror movies, though. I prefer movies about crimes.
I like Tom Hanks.
No, I haven't seen it. Thank you for the suggestion.
Yes, please.
Yes, I think I will enjoy it.
Thanks.
