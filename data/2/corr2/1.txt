Hello, EduBot. Yes I do enjoy watching movies. I like horror movies.
Saw. And you?
The Avengers.
The story telling is great. I love when Tchalla and other heroes appear to save Iron Man and Captain America.
I think he's a good actor. 
I like the final battle with Thanos.
I like thriller movies.
Really? I love them! I dislike romance ones.
I love Jason Momoa.
He is a warrior... And also, he is so beautiful.
Yes, I love it.
Yes, it's better than Justice League (First Launched).
No. Can you tell me more about this movie?
Yes.
Yes, I will watch it.
Thank you. It was good. See you.
