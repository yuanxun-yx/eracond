Oh really? Im a huge fan of movies too. I love action movies!
Last week I watched Dunkirk. I really love it! Have you seen it?
Yeah! that one. What do you think about it?
The war scenes, the action, the photography.
That is so cool! I think improvisation is part of the art.
I love the end but for me the best part is the bunker explosion!
I like action movies. Comedy movies are not my favorite. Some movies I like, some not. I like to take a popcorn, sit and watch an action movie.
I don't like romantic movies. I think they are the same, always the same ending. My girlfriend loves romantic movies. So, sometimes I watch with her. But it is not my first choice, hehe.
Oh boy, Leonardo DiCaprio is mine too. He deserve more Oscars I think. His acting is perfect. I very much like Titanic too.
I think he deserved it, but I did not watch Wolf of Wall Street. Do you recommend it for me?
Inception is one of my favorites! I watched it twice, just because of the ending. I love the soundtrack. I love Time by Hans Zimmer!
This one I did not! Sorry.
Yes! I have to leave now! Im going to watch a movie hehe. Goodbye.
