Hi, I do like movies in the genre of It.
It and the Thing, these horror movies are very good.
I like 007 which is an action movie.
I like the movie called Water for Elephants. Do you know it?
The characters are too good, but the drama that takes place in the film's story is impressive.
I didn't know that. I need to know more about it. She's a great writer.
Yes, the end of the movie is good, but the scene when the animal is abused hurts me.
I love comedy movies, they make me feel good and still cheer me up today.
I don't like sci-fi movies, but I have a lot of respect for those who like them.
I also like DiCaprio he is amazing. He's a very good actor.
I did not know that.
No thank you.
