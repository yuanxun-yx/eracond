I do! I love watching movies. Especially drama. Do you have any reccomendations for me?
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is my favorite.
Yes! That one.
The story behind it is great. Amazing soundtrack as well.
I loved it! Kaufman nailed it by suggesting that.
I love everything about it. How it confuses you until you get how the timelines are connected.
I love drama!
I don't like sci-fi movies.
I absolutely love Jared Leto and Nicole Kidman.
Wow. That's commitment... and also disgusting.
I haven't. What's it about?
Yes.
Not really, no.
