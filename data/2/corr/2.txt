Hi, I do like movies and their different genres.
It the Thing, this horror movie is very good.
I like 007 which is an action movie.
I like the movie called Waters for Elephants, do you know it?
The characters are too good, but the drama that takes place in the film's story is impressive.
I didn't know that, I have to know more about it, she's a great writer.
Yes, the end of the movie is good, but the scene when the animal gets abused hurts me.
I love comedy movies, it makes me feel good and it cheers me up throughout the day.
I don't like sci-fi movies, but I have a lot of respect for those who like them.
I also like DiCaprio, he is amazing, very good actor.
I do not know it.
No thank you.
