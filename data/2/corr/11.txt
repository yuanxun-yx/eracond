Yes actually I do.
I recently watched Free Guy.
Yes.
I think that Ryan Reynolds is a great actor.
Haha that is funny.
The part when he levels up his car, it was pretty cool.
Hum, Actualy I do watch many action movies.
I do not really appreciate French movies except comedy ones.
I really appreciate Johnny Depps.
Not especially.
Yes I've already seen it.
