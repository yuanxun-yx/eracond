Hi. I really love to watch movies.
I like The Devil Wears Prada.
I love the story, and I felt similar to the actress.
I didn't know that. I think they expended a lot of money on it.
I appreciate when they go to Paris.
I like suspense movies.
I don't like horror movies too, I prefer movies about crimes.
I like Ton Hanks.
No, I haven't seen it. Thank you for the suggestion.
Yes, please.
Yes, I think I will enjoy it.
Thanks.
