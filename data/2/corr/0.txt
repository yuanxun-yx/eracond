Oh really? I'm a huge fan of movies too. I love action movies!
Last week I watched Dunkirk. I really love it! Have you watched it?
Yeah! that one. What do you think of it?
The war scenes, the action, the photography.
That is so cool! I think improvisation is part of the arts.
I love the ending but for me the best part is the bunker explosion!
I like action movies. Comedy movies are not my favorite, some movies I like some not. I like to take a popcorn, sit and watch an action movie.
I don't like romantic movies. I think they are the same, always the same ending. My girlfriend loves romantic movies. So, sometimes I watch with her. But it's not my first option hehe.
Oh boy, Leonardo DiCaprio is mine too. He deserves more oscars I think. His acting is perfect. I like Titanic very much too.
I think he deserved it, but I did not watch Wlf of Wall Street. Do you recommend it to me?
Inception is one of my favorites! I watched it twice, just because of the ending. I love the soundtracks. I love Time of Hans Zimmer!
This one I did not! Sorry.
Yes! I have to leave now! I'm going to watch a movie hehe. Goodbye.
