Hi there. Yes, I really like watching movies, especially on Saturdays and Sundays.
Yes, it also helps me disconnect. The last movie I saw was called Oxygen.
Yes, did you see it too? What do you think about the film? Did you like it? 
I especially like that it kept me in suspense.
Wow I see you're very knowledgeable. I like this thing.
Yes, the ending is definitely a captivating one. I was kind of expecting another ending. 
I also like sci-fi movies. They make me think differently.
I don't like romantic movies. They are too syrupy and sometimes boring for me.
Yes he is a great actor for sure but I think I prefer Angelina Jolie instead.
Wow.
