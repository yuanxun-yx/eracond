Yes, I do.
I have a diverse mix of likes and dislikes. Mob and war movies are a sure hit with me. I believe Saving Private Ryan is my favorite.
Nightcrawler is one that I like and want to see again soon.
Yes, this one.
It was suspenseful, while being grounded in reality. Good acting too.
Dude is an amazing actor. I didn't know that, but I can believe it. It helped him compose the character.
That scene where he punches the mirror in the bathroom is amazing. You can see the main character psyche slipping in that moment.
War movies in general.
I don't have patience for those sappy romantic movies.
I don't have one. You can bet that the movie will be good when he is in it, like De Niro or Al Pacino, but I can't single any one out.
Cool, I didn't know that.
Yes, in cinema. Nail biting stuff.
No, I did not.
Sure, go ahead.
Sounds far fetched, but I would watch it if there is nothing else on.
Ok, goodbye.
