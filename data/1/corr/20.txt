Hip-hop.
Yes it is.
What is your favorite genre?
Oh, that is great.
No, I don't.
Really? I don't think so.
But I do like R&B too.
Why don't you like R&B?
Alright I see.
Drick Lamar is a great and cool musician.
I like prefer Elton John to Jay Z.
Not really. But he is a great musician too.
I once listened to some of his album but not anymore.
That should be "Stiillmatic" 2000 or 2001.
No I don't listen to his music.
Yes, sure. but I still don't like him.
Which other musicians do you like?
Dr Dre is a good guy too, I like him.
But you initially said you don't like hip-hop music.
Alright it's nice chatting with you.
I have to go now.
