Hi.
Ok.
My problem in language speaking.
The basic words.
The English word for bangus fish.
I have a friend from the US. We had a conversation and I don't know the word bangus in English, so it was hard for me to communicate with her.
No. she is American.
She is not online now, maybe it's nighttime there.
I hope so.
Maybe Google.
Good day.
