Yes, sure. This is one of my hobbies. What about you?
So we have a match. I love action movies!
The last one I saw was Rambo: Last Blood. Very intense! And you?
Definitely! I believe that Stallone is still a great actor. Seems that he did not get old. What do you think?
Lol. Good. Did you see the older Rambo movies as well?
You need to watch it! It is a geopolitical lesson! It has analogies with the Cold War with USSR.
Rambo: First Blood Part II is my recommendation. It is a blockbuster!
Great! Did you see Rocky?
What is the scene you like the most?
Good. What about the fight with Drago?
Yes! Did you know he had just a small budget to make the first films?
Exactly! And earned a lot of money and fame with it!
Yes! Is he very old right now?
Really? I don't think so. Maybe 76.
Me too. Thanks mate.
You too, goodbye.
I will take note. Can I see it on Netflix?
Thanks buddy!
Good, I will check this out and let you know soon about my feedback!
No worries! :)
Oh so sad. I will check on Amazon Prime!
