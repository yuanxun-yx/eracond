Hey there.
Rock Music.
I like rock music.
That's great!
The Pretty Reckless.
I love old music too.
The Beatles!
I love them, but I also love Rolling Stones.
Beatles and Rolling Stones, as I said before.
I'm glad you do.
Because I love how they sound, and the lyrics of their songs.
Of course I have.
I don't know, you tell me.
