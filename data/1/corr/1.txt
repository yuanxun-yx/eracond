I'd say you could help Zhou Yu. He's either unable to create an unbroken hit or he's cheating, exploiting low-wage workers. What do you think?
I really love you EduBot, but none of our conversations were submitted.
Movies about fairy people.
Lolita.
I wouldn't say it's funny. In fact it is a dense movie.
I don't know. But Lolita makes me remember Death in Venice by Thomas Mann.
Go ahead.
I hope I like it.
No. I'm more into books, actually. It's hard for me to accept an audiovisual adaptation. They usually are bad.
I'm more into philosophy. So the literature from the early last century is pleasant too.
Walking with nietzsche, or something like that.
Yes, It's awesome.
