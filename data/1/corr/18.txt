Hello. I like some movies!
I like war movies.
Gerard Butler. Do you know any film he acts in?
That is fine. I like the movie "300".
I don't like it much. I'm so scared.
Yes, but I watch Korean romantic movies.
I also like sci-fi movies, and you?
Have you seen Star Wars?
What is your preferred movie?
What is your preferred romantic movie?
Yes, I would!
Star Wars is one of the best, but the last films are not so good, in my opinion.
The Rise of Skywalker, is not so good.
You are a fan of Star Wars, we can say!
Have you seen the Lords of the Rings?
Yes, all the films!
What other epic film have you seen?
Yes, that is fine, but the Last Hobbit was worse than the first!
The Return, absolutely!
It is good, but not like the previous ones. The Revenge.
Yes, but this is enough. Bye!
