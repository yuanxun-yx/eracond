Good morning, I'm fine, thanks. And you?
Hey, listen, I am dead bored. Can you recommend me any movie?
I love sci-fi movies although I also like anime.
Specifically, I like movies about catastrophic futures and utopias, where something has already happened and the plot trigger is already on the move.
I am in the mood for one of those movies. Have you heard about "The Man in the Castle"?
It is based on the book of the same title by Philip K. Dick. It is about an alternate reality in which the Nazis have won WWII.
No, never heard of it. What is it about?
Mmmm. Not sure about it. Hey, what about anime?
One never would have told. I know about him because of the WWE shows and that wrestling thing. It is incredible how the perception of people can change because of being an actor.
I never really liked music movies. I find them kind of boring, with no plot to follow, always singing. From that, you can infer I am not a music person, hahaha.
Definitely like his "The Rock" character. At least one can have fun and have a good experience watching an action movie.
Well, thank you for your time and suggestions. We'll talk some other day. See you, goodbye.
