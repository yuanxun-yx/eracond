Hi, can you recommend me from the recent action fantasy based movies?
Thanks.
Detective and fiction adventures also.
Yes, I particularly like the Sherlock series.
Yes.
I cant remember the name from Men in Black series.
Interesting.
Okay, returning back to our starting point, can you recommend me any of the high gross box office movies?
I cant get you really, I think you missed the point.
So?
You mean the word salad.
Thats what I asked you actually.
No, because the movies you told were pseudo it seems.
Now we are coming in terms. Sure, that was a good one with a psychiatric point of view.
Now yes.
Thank you.
Is it a gratitude loophole?
I will try.
