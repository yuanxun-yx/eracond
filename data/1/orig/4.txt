Good morning, I´m fine, thanks. And you?
Hey, listen, I am dead bored. Can you recommend me any movie?
I love sci-fi movies although I also like anime
Specifically, I like movies about catasthropic futures and utopias, where something has already happened and the plot trigger is already on the move
I am in the mood of one of those movies. Have you heard about "The man in the Castle"?
It is based on the book of the same title of Philip K. Dick. It is about a new reality in which the nazis have won WWII
No, never heard of. What is it about?
Mmmm. Not sure about it. Hey, what about anime?
One never would have told. I know about him because of the WWE showas and that wrestling thing. It is incredible how the perception of people can change because of being an actor
I never really liked music movies. I find them kind of boring, with no plot to follow, always singing. From that, you can interfere I am not a music person, je je je
Definetely like his "the rock" character. At least one can have fun and having a good experience watching an action movie
Well, thank you for your time and suggestions. We´ll talk some other day. See you, goodbye
