Hello there little fellow
I was told that you might be able to assist me with some movie recommendations today.
Well, lets see, that is a bit of a tough question. I certainly enjoy movies with deep and intricate plots. Furthermore, I do like the occasional parody scene or humorous easteregg. What else would like to know?
Oddly, that would be Forest Gump. I know that this movie does not really have any of the qualities I described before, except maybe for the humorous easter egg thing, but it left a lasting impression. I really enjoyed Tom Hanks delivery. Made me appreciate him more as an actor.
Yeah I see where you are coming from. I do have to confess it did not feel long while I was watching it for the first time. On retrospect though, you may be right. Also I think you wanted to use too instead of to in your last sentence.
Well the hero does not die and he gets insanely rich. That is good to know beforehand as his story is quite sad for the most part of the movie. That might bring some people down, but they just have to hold till the end where the tables turn.
Yes that is the basis of  US blockbusters nowadays. People like a happy ending but demand some hero hardship prior to its delivey for them to rejoice.
I agree my friend
