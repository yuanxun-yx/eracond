Hi, could you recommend good action movies?
Of action
Nice! This satisfies me equally. Im not into romance movies either.
I even watch. But in general, I find this kind of movie boring. Is that you?
I recently watched Memento. Its a great movie, one of the best Ive ever seen.
From the script. This movie is literally exceptional, the unfolding of this drama is unlike anything anyone has ever seen.
In truth no. I prefer harder movies.
I like the last option yes.
According.
I understand. Usually a good movie with this theme also makes me recommend it.
Interesting.
In truth no. By the way, unfortunately I have to withdraw.
Nothing else. Goodbye.
