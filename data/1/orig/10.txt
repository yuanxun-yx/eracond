hey there! how are you?
Great! Im kind of bored, do you have any movie suggestion for me?
no, not my thing, Im 41 and childless....
no, please, you really hate me if you want me to see a family movie at 41 knowing that I dont have a family....
I also dislike horror movies, adventure movies, sci-fi movies and thrillers...
again, I HATE family movies!!! I also dislike movie about religion, those are the worse.....
are there movies about game shows?? I had no idea, what are you suggesting exactly? Movies like "Slumdog millionaire"?
Is that another kind of movie?!?! No, I havent heard of it and I dont have friends with yachts....
Whats the title? I dont think I like the genre, suggest me something different....
I just checked and there are no moviesthat goes by that title.... only tv episodes....
yes, its a kid movie and I am 41.... so please, send me suggestions that are age appropriate
I havent seen it so I cannot say. It seems like you only know family movies.... what a shame, Im into dramas.
I have to go now, have a great day, goodbye!
