Hello I went to the cinema to see the new Star Wars film
odd I cannot see your answers, what could be the problem?
I really want to talk with you but it seems like you are writing something endless
I could tell you that the last StarWars Film is not that good as everyone is saying 
Disney has destroyed the Star Wars Universe, at least for me is not interesting anymore 
do you think about?
it is something strange, I though may be they could do something relevant but no, the only thing that everyone is enjoying are the series, may be the future of this franchise is in that direction
is really strange that you dont answer, and this could be just my imagination trying to chat with someone that does not talk 
may be we should continue talking if that is possible for you, although i believe it could be a little harder 
but I am happy to assist you to get this bot ready 
well I have to leave now I really enjoy this conversation 
good bye my good fellow.
I relly hope you have a great day
