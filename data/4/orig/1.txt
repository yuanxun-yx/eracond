I recently watched Minutemen with my sister on Disney+
I really like the Harry Potter Saga and recently watched the first and the second one
My favorite movie in the saga is The Prisoner of Azkaban
Yes, thats the one!
I think it was a great movie not only because of the acting, but also because of the beautiful scenarios and plot line.
Well, I think thats great since most of the actors were kids at the time.
For sure loved the ending! But also the whole aesthetic of the movie was just so beautiful!
I love comedy too! But Im a sucker for some good romance and mistery
We have similiar taste! I also dont enjoy horror movies or even thrillers
My favorite is brad pitt.
i think he gave himself to the movie
