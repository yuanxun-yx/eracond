Hello
Yesterday I watched the movie IT, after finishing the book.
I dont usually watch horror movie but that was an exception since I really liked the book. I would usually watch comedy or romantic movies like The devil wears Prada.
Yes, that one. I really like Anne Hathaway and I watched and loved a lot of movies she starred in like Princess Diares; of course, other than her, Meryl Streep is a fantastic, experienced actress who I also like.
I feel like they were able to make a great plot from a simple concept and that made the movie become a classic for many generations to come. The acting was also a big part of its success, as I said before, there are a lot of talented people working in it.
Wow I didnt know they spent so much on the costuming. Its interesting and I can see why they did it, and honestly the costumes were amazing and in the end the  cost was worth it
I like the turning point; the part where Anne Hathway realized that she is becoming someone who isnt her true self and goes back too who se originally was
Me too I really like comedies especially when Im down, like something with Adam Sandler
I dont really like sci-fi movies as they bore me easily and would prefer a horror movie over them
My favourite actor is also Leonardo Dicaprio. I mean its a classic and he is spectacular in everything he does
