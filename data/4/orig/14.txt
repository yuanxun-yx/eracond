Hey
Whats your favourite actress?
I cant read what youre saying
I like Blade Runner very much. Its among my favourite films 
Have you ever watched it?
yes, i love this movie, but another movie i love a lot is also iron man
I love all MAarvel movies, they are all well produced and have a great story
my dream is to meet these international actors, go to los angeles and meet them
Its a shame that the ticket, accommodation and passport visa are so expensive and I dont have such good financial conditions.
Many friends of mine have already been to the US, but most go to Orlando, a place that I think is beautiful but I dont think it would be a destination that would please me so much.
Im kind of scared of amusement parks, which is why I didnt think I would have enough fun, my dream is to go to calidornia and los angeles
walk in the Hall of Fame, take a picture with the famous wax sculptures and maybe I cant see an artist walking down the street
I myself have heard that I could also visit the warner bross studios
