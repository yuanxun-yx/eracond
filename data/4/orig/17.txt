Hey, what kind of movies do you enjoy the most?
I have always enjoyed romantic comedy films. Are you familiar with those?
I think that Keanu Reeves is quite overrated. Whats your opinion on that?
Its not often I enjoy a Clint Eastwood film, but occasionally he dives into racial issues in his films.
Are you aware of any good acting companies that have good reputations amongst the various acting agencies?
Im not a fan of Star Wars, I always thought it was for children. I prefer Dune.
I liked Daniel Craig as James Bond, but much prefer Roger Moore.
A lot of movie stars live in Vancouver, but the cost of living there is quite high. Unless you are a rich movie star!
Are you a LOTR fan, or did you think The Hobbit was better?
I hope a GOT films gets made, what did you think about the series ending?
