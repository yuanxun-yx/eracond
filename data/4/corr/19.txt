I really enjoy watching movies. How about you? Do you also like watching movies?
Venom.
I also Like Djano Unchained. Do you know about it?
Yes. 300. Have you heard about it?
Donnie Darko is a good movie. It's really hard to understand because the plot is about time traveling.
I also like Harry Potter. It's one of my favorites. I got used to watching it when I was a kid.
Yes. Do you know Lord of the Rings? It's an awesome movie about Middle Earth. You definitely should watch. It's my advice to you!
Have you seen Injustice?
I think mostly about the fact that it's about DC heroes and villains. I especially love the comic book universe and I love it when I see it in the movies.
Yes. Definitely the ending was really crazy and beautiful. My favorite part is also the end.
I like horror. It's one of my favorite genres ever. What comedy movies did you watch before?
I don't like war movies in general. I prefer movies with less tension or with more focus on dialogues you know.
Asa Butterfield. He did Sex Education and I loved it. He is a great actor actually.
