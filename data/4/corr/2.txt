Hello there.
How was your day ? I hope you had a good time today.
Where are you right now? Are you working or just chilling?
May I ask what are you doing today? 
I did not not get any response yet. Is there anything wrong about the net? Or it was just really like this?
Do you also love or like the movie Harry Potter?
Harry Potter was one of the most beautiful series I ever watched. I was able to watch from the first episode up until the last one, The Deathly Hallows.
How about you? What kind of movie genres are most likely for you to watch?
For me I really do like Action movies, Adventures, Horror and also Love stories too.
