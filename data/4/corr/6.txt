HI, DO YOU LIKE THE GHOST HUNT MOVIE?
I LOVE SEEING GHOST HUNTERS.
I LOVE DC MOVIES.
MY FAVORITE MOVIE IS BY MARVELS, IRON MAN.
IT IS AWESOME, VERY REALISTIC AND A PERFECT STORY.
IT'S A DIFFERENT MOVIE, THERE ARE NOT MANY LIKES.
I LIKE THE SERIES A LOT. MY FAVORITE IS BLIND WEDDING.
BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE ARE IN LOVE.
AND I LOVE ROMANCE, ESPECIALLY WITH MARRIAGES.
BUT I ALSO LOVE EXPLOSIVE ACTION SERIES.
