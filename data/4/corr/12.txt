Hello.
My name's Joao Victor.
I love to watch tv.
I love Iron Man 2.
I live in Brazil
I really like action movies that have explosions.
My favorite is Faster and More Furious.
I love Toretto, an amazing man. All his movies are good.
It's a shame that Paul Walker died. I also liked your movies a lot, I miss you.
STOP
My other favorite movies are the drama ones that have good stories.
I love horror movies too, but it has to be really good to be able to scare me haha.
