Hey.
What's your favourite actress?
I can't read what you're saying.
I like Blade Runner very much. It's among my favourite films.
Have you ever watched it?
Yes, I love this movie, but another movie I love a lot is also Iron Man.
I love all Marvel movies. They are all well produced and have great stories.
My dream is to meet these international actors, go to Los Angeles and meet them.
It's a shame that the ticket, accommodation and passport visa are so expensive and I don't have such good financial conditions.
Many friends of mine have already been to the US, but most go to Orlando, a place that I think is beautiful but I don't think it would be a destination that would please me so much.
I'm kind of scared of amusement parks, which is why I didn't think I would have enough fun. My dream is to go to California and Los Angeles.
Walk in the Hall of Fame, take a picture with the famous wax sculptures and maybe I can't see an artist walking down the street.
I myself have heard that I could also visit the Warner Bros. studios.
