Hello.
Yesterday I watched the movie IT, after finishing the book.
I don't usually watch horror movies, but that was an exception since I really liked the book. I would usually watch comedy or romantic movies like The Devil Wears Prada.
Yes, that one. I really like Anne Hathaway and I watched and loved a lot of movies she starred in like Princess Diaries; of course, other than her, Meryl Streep is a fantastic, experienced actress whom I also like.
I feel like they were able to make a great plot from a simple concept and that made the movie become a classic for many generations to come. The acting was also a big part of its success. As I said before, there were a lot of talented people working on it.
Wow I didn't know they spent so much on the costuming. It's interesting and I can see why they did it, and honestly the costumes were amazing and in the end the cost was worth it.
I like the turning point; the part where Anne Hathway realizes that she is becoming someone who isn't her true self and goes back to who she originally was.
Me too, I really like comedies especially when I'm down, like something with Adam Sandler.
I don't really like sci-fi movies as they bore me easily and would prefer a horror movie over them.
My favourite actor is also Leonardo Dicaprio. I mean it's a classic and he is spectacular in everything he does.
