Hi!
Alright? Talk to me.
Would you recommend any good movies?
I like Pulp Fiction and action movies in general. Is that you?
Yes, The Count of Monte Cristo.
Yes! Exactly.
First, the story is quite iconic, so much so that there are several movies and series, even soap operas based on this story of Monte Cristo. Nevertheless, the film has a good script, and finally, I identify a lot with the work.
Interesting what you said! Honestly, I'll know a little more about this! The story itself fascinates me. It helped me in a difficult time.
The ending is captivating yes. I agree with you, when I just want to review excerpts, I always end up prioritizing the last scenes of the film.
I particularly prefer action movies.
Tipe Pulp Fiction.
That's all for now. I need to leave. It was great talking to you.
