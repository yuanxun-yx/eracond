I really enjoy watching movies. What kind of movies do you like most?
Yes. I really like 300. Have you heard about it?
One of my favorites is Lord of the Rings. Do you know about it?
Yes. Last week I watched Injustice with my girlfriend and we like it a lot.
Us. It's a new movie.
Do you know Watchmen? It's based on one of the most strong characters from the comics.
Parasite. Have you heard about it?
Superman is quite good isn't it?
I think it was the main fight between Superman and the villain. It was a really great movie!!!
The movie release was like a celebration then, wasn't it?
