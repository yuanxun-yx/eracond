Hello EduBot.
My name is Jean-Pierre and I am in the last year of Bachelor in Electronics.
And I live in Nice.
And today my goal is to talk with you. So can you help me resolve some problems?
I need to look for information about the Arduino Board.
This information is how I can get the data sheet of the Arduino Leonardo?
I want to work in aerospace automation.
Did you get my information?
I need also the world news and all of the information about COVID-19.
How much is the new iPhone 13 on Amazon?
Maybe I will change my phone, and I would like to buy the iPhone 13.
I think it is amazing, this new iPhone.
Since talking with you, I don't get any answer from you.
I need responses.
