I am not travelling much these days.
I play videogames.
Shopping online is fine, but we cannot lock down forever.
Maybe in the beginning but now I think my diet is the same as before.
Sometimes it is hard, not meeting anybody.
It was really hard especially in the beginning. Now I feel used to it, even if I do not like it.
I like going out to the gardens and parks.
