Hello , thanks for asking. Basically I never really travelled before but coronavirus hasn't really affected my life. I can travel anywhere (or almost) I want now.
I started to read books about self improvement, cooking, programming skills, cryptoccurencies, Mturk, some exercise, a better diet and helping the people I love.
I think masks and gloves are a safe way to have contact with people in case of contaminations like these days.
My diet is way better than before. I started eating a lot of vegetables that I grow myself. But yeah people are getting less lazy as they don't have anything to do during quarantine.
I felt quite down during quarantine but you get used to it and found new ways to be happy , you could always socialize online with internet and makke new friends around the world and pass the time with them
It's not hard to practice. It's self discipline and a lot of values don't have these values.
I'll try to do that the next few months, socialize and get new good friends to grow my finances and businesses.
