I'm also unable to travel too, unfortunately.
I like to play video games, watch movies, series and media in general.
Shopping online is a good choice. It helps stopping the virus spread and also gives you more choices to choose from. It's a win-win situation. 
Yep, I've been buying more takeouts than usual hahaha.
Yes, it's a hard situation. I'm a very sociable person, so I do miss gatherings a lot.
Well I don't see it as a hard thing to do and I see how crucial its practice is. So I try to always stay in a secured distance from other people.
Spending time out would be nice but with the virus spreading, I don't think it's a good choice as of now...
