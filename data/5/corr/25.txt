Yeah! That's true. covid has caused a lot of inconvenience since people can't move around as before.
Relaxing, working from home, and I've had a lot of time to bond with my kids.
Yeah, I myself prefer online shopping. If I can get something online, there is no need for me to go out.
It has definitely changed since now that I'm home, I find myself eating healthy.
It is kind of depressing but you get used to it with time. Boredom comes when you want to go out with friends but you can't.
It is hard because at some point you will find yourself getting close to them or touching the same things they do without even noticing.
That's a great idea. I'm looking forward to doing that.
