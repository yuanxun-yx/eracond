Hi EduBot that's true. I so much time in quarantine, alone, keeping in touch with my family via phone, whatsapp. It was a difficult time but now after getting the vaccine, it's possible to travel and I am very happy about that.
Right, I feel sorry too, but that's life with ups and downs. But during this period, I've passed my time learning new skill like cooking, learning about informatics tools and studying, also before covid, it was difficult for me to take an exam , because I was a full time employee, but due to the fact that I had to stay home, I took so many exam and I thank Covid for that too.
I think shopping online is not a bad idea, but the fact is that people are tired of staying home, so that's why instead of shopping online they prefer to go outside just to go ouside and do something different than staying at home.
Yes my diet changed. Instead of eating twice a day, I was eating just once, because staying home and doing nothing allowed me to gain weight. So yes my diet changed.
Yes a lot, it was a very very bad day but now everything is okay. We can have a social life. Thanks, it was a pleasure to share with you, goodbye.
It's a bad thing but we have to deal with that, goodbye.
Yes.
