It is true. In my case, I was confined at home for a period of three months.
Actually, I was fortunate because I could work at home, so I did not have much time to spare. I don´t like cooking at all and I don´t have a garden so cooking and gardening were out of the question. I just tried to relax and chill out after work.
It depends on who you ask. Myself, I prefer to go shopping whenever is possible.  Online shopping is also an option to buy things abroad or that you cannot get easily in your town.
Not really. As I told you before I don't apreciate the art of cuisine very much so I pretty much stick to the same dishes, that is: pasta, rice and Mediterranean food.
It was difficult sometimes, yes. I live alone and not being able to feel the presence of someone is a bit hard to endure. 
Most definitely, especially Latin people. We are so close, with a preference for touching and being in groups every day. However, everybody must make the effort to follow the rules, otherwise this situation will be out of our hands.
I believe a lot of people realised that when they were confined. Spending time outdoors with nice weather and sunshine, just walking, is a good way to relax and forget about everyday problems.
