I can't travel either :( Do you have any other plans?
I listen to music, watch TV, and play video games. And you?
Yeah, I love online shopping too. What do you often shop for online?
No, my weight is still the same I guess. My body is not easy to gain weight. And you?
Yes, I feel lonely and depressed a lot during the lockdown.
I think it's a rough time for some people and some people get emotional.
I love going outside like fishing, hiking, and running.
