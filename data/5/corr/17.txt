I want to travel a lot but right now, it is not possible.
I'm studying guitar.
It is a good idea, but how do you feel with the time you have to wait?
Yes I'm not eating well these days.
I feel down everyday, quarantine doesn't scare me at all.
No I do not think it's hard to practice. I don't like people.
I'm practicing mindfulness.
