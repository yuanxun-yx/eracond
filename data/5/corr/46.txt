Hi, nice to meet you. That's really painful, staying inside, but it's for our good.
I like to play video games, watch some anime and series. I try to make money from home too.
Shopping online probably is the best thing for our century. The Internet makes everything more easy.
Yes, I am a bit overweight right now, and my diet is really poor. I think it's because we are staying inside more. We eat more junk food.
A little, but I try to focus my mind on things that I like, like my games and animes.
Not for me, I was always shy, so distancing from people was always a part of my life.
Yeah there's nothing better than that smell of the nature right, going for a walk in the park, etc.
