Hi edubot, how are you first? Then it is true, many people lately are unable to travel due to this pandemic. But lately I have managed to go to Rome for a pleasure trip.
I'm a student so I spent all of my free time studying anatomy books.
I believe that with due care you can do everything and you can even go out to go shopping. But it's a subjective thing and you have to feel comfortable.
During this quarantine I tried to create some new recipes. But yes I changed my diet during this period.
Many times. When these moments take me, however, I try to think about everything positive this period of loneliness is giving me, such as being able to know myself better.
I am in a relationship and during this period we had to figure out a way to see each other without seeing each other.
You're right in fact. During this period I tried to stay as much as possible in the open air, so much so that I started riding a bike. I hope you are trying to do the same too.
