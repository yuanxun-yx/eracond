Hi! Nice to meet you. Well it's a good question. I agree that traveling is getting harder because of restrictions due to the covid pandemic. I used to travel for work and now its all stopped.
I usually just relax scrolling facebook or watching Netflix series.
I think that if you keep precautions and avoid crowded places, there is no issue in going out.
It's not changed, but since I work from home I rarely have the time to cook during lunch time and thats bad. I could say my diet didn't change but my habits did.
I really feel down staying at home all day. I wish I could work at the office more often.
I think it is hard. Luckily all my closest friends and parents are vaccinated.
Thank you for your advice. I definitely need to do something like that, especially unplug from technology :)
