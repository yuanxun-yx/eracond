I also cannot travel. Can't even go back to the village. The goverment is very strict here.
Most the of time I cook and watch television. Sometimes I wash clothing.
Yes now it's very dangerous to go outside the house, even if you wear a mask. The covid virus can still get to us.
Now I have to budget my food. I cook.
Sometimes when I feel down, I sing karaoke. I also do zumba dance.
I have no problem social distancing. Better that way. If we're too close to people, we don't know who has the virus.
Yeah that's not a bad idea. I will try it and make it a very good habit. Thank you.
