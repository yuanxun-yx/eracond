I haven't travelled yet since the first lockdown, but I'm planning to start the next winter in a big city.
In my free time I watch a lot of TV series in English, so I can improve my listening skills. I also like cooking when I don't have anything else to do, and my favorite receipes are the cake and cheescake ones.
I think that online shopping is easy and convenient but it is very different from buying in the shops, because for example, you can see if the clothes suits you and if the material is fine.
My diet hasn't changed at all, but unfortunately I'm eating more than before. I'm concerned about the clothes that won't fit me well.
No, I feel quiet and relaxed because I'm doing everything at home.
