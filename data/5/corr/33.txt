Hey, I don't travel that much, just for work and so far so good.
I usually read books and ebooks, play videogmaes, play piano and guitar. Music is my passion.
Yes, indeed. It's not safe. I prefer staying at home and I say the same to my parents and friends. It's hard but we have to do it.
No, my diet is the same. Fortunately I can buy all my stuff in my local shops. I can go there by foot. The problem is not what I eat but how much I eat.
Sometimes. I fill depressed several times in the years and quaratine didn't change my routine. 
Yes, I do. But after almost 2 years I'm used to. It's sad to say that, but it's the truth.
I spend lots of time outside. I'm a cyclist and I love nature.
