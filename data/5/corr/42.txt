Luckily I'm traveling around in Europe, I like to discover new places.
I play videogames, watch TV, work when possible, stay with family.
I prefer shopping outside, It's always better seeing the real product before buying it.
It's kind of always the same, I haven't changed my diet.
Every day, it's not easy to be forced inside the house.
It's not hard, but it's not always possible, especially in small places.
It sounds like a great advice!
