I can't travel also. Corona virus has caused no movement in my country.
I try to do things around the house. I like cooking and gardening. what about you?
I think that's a good idea. The less you go out the more safer you become. I love shopping online. What about yourself?
I love eating fast food. Fast food is bad for my health but it tastes so good. What do you eat?
I have never felt depressed because I have family. Family is good support in troubled times.
Social distancing is great. I think it's fairly easy to do.
That is good advice. I will try it.
