It was the same for me. Depending on how bad the lockdown was, I couldn't leave my town without documents.
Play videogames, watch movies, and read books. I like streaming on Twitch, too.
I'm less afraid of covid now, especially being vaccinated, so I'm more than okay with people shopping in person so long as they follow the rules.
Not really. I mainly eat the same things, which was already pretty varied. I learned how to make Japanese curry during the pandemic.
No, I love staying at home. I am like a cat who sleeps all day. Zero problems for me.
I don't think so. I just think people only think that because they don't take this deadly pandemic seriously. They should be more responsible.
Good advice, but it's almost winter now so there's no sunshine or blue skies, hehe.
