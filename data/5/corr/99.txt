Hi, it's good to talk to you too. It's true, covid has prevented many people from traveling because countries have closed borders.
What you said is very applicable! Because of the pandemic I developed the hobby of reading and I am enjoying it a lot!
Buying online is perfect, you don't need to risk getting infected and you can do it from your bed if you want.
My diet has changed a lot since the beginning of the pandemic. I used to cook more, but now I'm ordering my food. It's much more practical and I can eat different things every day.
Who didn't feel bad, right? I believe I felt bad many days, but I learned to deal with this feeling and see the good side of things.
Social distancing is something very cruel analyzing it closely, because we can't hug or kiss those we like. We can't go to parties and as soon as we leave the house, it's very sad.
I do this every morning when I run in my neighborhood. It's very refreshing and I can spend the rest of the day in a good mood because of it.
