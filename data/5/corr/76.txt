I wish I could go to Europe, but with the coronavirus I can't leave my country.
When the coronavirus first started I stayed at home and tried learning to play guitar. Now playing guitar is my new hobby.
I think everyone should shop online nowadays because there is no reason not to. It is so quick and easy. I shop online all the time!
To be honest my diet changed for the worse after, now that I've been in quarantine. I am not much of a cook so I mostly eat frozen food and noodles.
Absolutely. Sometimes I feel down because I don't have anyone to talk to and can't see my friends and my family in person. There's just something about having someone's company in person that just makes me feel better.
It is definitely hard to practice social distancing because human beings are made for human touch and affection. So to be robbed of that because of the virus is very hard.
Well, I will be sure to try that. I usually do go outside, but I think it would be good for me to be in touch with nature.
