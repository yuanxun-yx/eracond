Currently I am only planning vacations in my home country, but I really would like to travel abroad again.
Surfing aimlessly on the Internet.
You should still get out somewhere. Staying home 100% isn't good for your mental health.
My diet hasn't changed much, but I love experimenting with new recipes. 
I am an introvert, and so I believe I can adjust to this situation better than others.
I haven't seen some close relatives in a while. That's kind of hard, indeed.
Oh, I go mountain biking when the weather is right.
