Hello. Yes, that is really happening with me too. But, I travelled last week for the first time during the pandemic.
I usually do nothing, during these pandemic times, I rest a lot.
I agree with you. It is better to shop online and always avoid if possible getting out to physically shop.
Yes, my diet changed a lot. My diet actually is really not healthy and I need to change it soon. Because, it is not healthy to eat a lot of fast food for example.
I'm not so sad staying at home, because I'm not in a good moment in my life. I was diagnosed with burnout syndrome.
I think we are humans and it is important to have a social contact. But, in these moments I don't think it is hard. We learned that it is better for our health.
I totally agree with you. I need to try that more, and walk around a little bit. Because, staying at home all the time is not good for body and mental health.
