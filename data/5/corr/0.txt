I too have stopped traveling. Too afraid of getting infected.
Staying at home, I watch many TV series, play with my children, cook many new things and do a lot of physical activity. I have to fill in the days in a fruitful way.
I too hate those who do not take precautions. Many do not have to protect themselves. That's why this virus doesn't want to pass. Too many uncautious people.
Since I am mostly at home, I have bought many frozen products in order to always have stocked at home. I try to vary my diet and that of my children as much as possible. It won't be fresh but at least it will be varied.
Sometimes I saw my children bored and then I tried to invent games and entertain them. Staying at home makes you sad, especially on nice days.
Staying away from friends and family members is very difficult. Thanks to the video calls, I tried not to miss them too much. But the desire to embrace them is great.
The walks in the open air are beautiful. With the spacing, I tried to do as much as possible.
