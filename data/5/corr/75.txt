Well, I'm from Italy and I can travel to the whole European Union even though it's not advisable.
Not much. I'm a student so I just study or watch some TV shows. Sometimes I work out.
I don't think they should shop online more. I don't like it very much. People can shop outside, however they should be careful.
Not that much. Maybe I eat a bit less than before, but that's because I'm a bit lazy sometimes.
Yes, but that's not because of the virus.
Not for me. I'm not the kind of person who usually touches or talks really close to people.
Well, the weather here is not that good. It's raining right now. I don't think my problem will go away by unplugging for 30 minutes from the internet. But I appreciate the suggestion.
