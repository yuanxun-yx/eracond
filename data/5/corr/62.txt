I usually create tutorial videos about the different software during this time.
Yes online shopping is really safe and better, because you can place your orders online at home, so better you should not go outside during this period.
I think my diet has changed during this time, because now I eat more while staying at home.
I don't feel depressed all the time, but sometimes I feel something weird at home.
Social distancing is difficult sometimes, especially when we meet with our relatives. That time is difficult.
