I can't travel because of Corona virus lockdown.
I work in my garden, I love to garden a lot.
I think that is great idea to shop online. I do online shopping most of the time.
My diet changed very much. I eat the same food for days. Very boring.
No I don't. I have a wife and children so we interact with each other all the time. What do you think of social distancing?
Social distancing feels weird and I try to do it all the time when I go to public places.
I go to my garden all the time for self-care practice and relaxation.
