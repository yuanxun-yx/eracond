Yes, you're right, but I'm not really into travelling because I study at university, and I don't have much time to spend for holidays.
I usually study for my exams, watch Youtube videos, and I usually practice my coding skills.
Yes I love online shopping. It's really convenient and nowadays. With Amazon Prime we have almost instantaneous delivery.
Yes it has changed. I try to keep a healthier lifestyle and also eat more vegetables and fruits that are necessary for our bodies.
We're not in quarantine anymore but when we first entered quarantine I felt really sad and depressed because I had to give up all my daily tasks, such as school and other stuff.
Yes it is really difficult and challenging.
Yes, I completely agree, in fact I often walk in the park near my university.
