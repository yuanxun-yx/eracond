I spend most of my time studying, but in my free time I often watch YT videos and also practice my coding skills.
Yes, I love online shopping, thanks to Amazon Prime we have instant delivery so it's really convenient.
Yes it has changed for the better because I have more time to prepare my meals so I pay more attention to what I eat.
Yes I felt really depressed during quarantine. I had to give up everything.
Social distancing is really difficult, especially between friends and stuff, but it will be over soon.
Yes I really like to walk in the park near my university and I always spend some time outside!
