Hi, nice talking to you too! Since I'm a student, I'm allowed to travel with almost no restrictions. Of course, I have to wear a mask and keep social distance but at least I can visit my family often and go to university in a different city to study.
Oh I feel like I've lived a lockdown for my entire life! I love reading books, listening to music, watching TV series and attending online courses on different topics.
Of course shopping online is a good idea because of covid, but I feel like it's easier to shop online thus we consume more.
Oh my mom is an excellent cook, so even during the lockdown my diet hasn't changed.
Honestly I always prefer staying alone than spending time with other people so I don't feel depressed.
Yes it is hard, emotional proximity beats social distance.
I already meditate every day but thanks for the advice!
