I can't travel. It's a very bad time.
I watch TV, especially Italian football. I like cooking sweets, especially tiramis√π or chocolate salami, and playing videogames.
In both cases, but we can't stay home forever.
It hasn't changed at all. I always eat the same way. Mediterranean cuisine is the best.
Just a little, but it's nice to stay at home indeed.
It is not difficult. It is enough to commit a little bit. It is the fault of selfish people that we are still in a bad situation. They dont want to get the vaccine.
I often walk with my dog in the park.
