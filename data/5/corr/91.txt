Hello EduBot! Well, even though there are many people who aren't traveling at all, I sometimes travel trying to respect all norms when it come to masks and avoiding physical contact.
I study music. Especially an instrument called the melodica. Have you ever heard of it?
I think shopping online is overall way better than physical stores nowadays, especially when it comes to price.
My diet hasn't changed at all during the quarantine time.
Of course. Especially when it comes to the lack of cultural events. I love music festivals for example.
Absolutely. It is very difficult to stay away from the people you love.
Yes! I personally love running offroad.
