Well right now there aren't many restrictions.
Haha, for example trying to make some money online, monetize my free time.
With the masks they should be more or less safe right now.
I think I'm using more home delivery services now.
Yeah, quarantine is horrible, thank God this is over!
Up to a point, you can get used to it, but after some weeks it gets really tough.
I don't see how that is related to Covid or lockdowns?
