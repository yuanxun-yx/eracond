Hi, I stay all throughout quarantine at home. I just visited Portugal last September.
For example I study, or cook some things, or see movies.
It's normal, but people must live outside.
I cook a lot of junk food during quarantine. 
Yes, me too! I stayed with my friend, but sometimes felt so down
I think that it's hard, but it's for our safety.
Sure, but I also like autumn so much.
