Yeah, the closest international border is closed.
I work from home, so sometimes I just work more in my spare time. If I don't feel like working or doing chores, I watch TV, read, or listen to podcasts.
I think shopping is mostly a safe activity. Little to no prolonged interaction with anyone. Most people mask up where I live, and vaccination rates are high.
Yup, my diet has changed. Not eating outside meant I could watch what I eat and actually weigh everything and do calorie counting, I actually lost a lot of weight. I also did try to figure new ingredients into my cooking -- marinating chicken in yogurt is a new family favorite.
Sure, who doesn't. But I already worked from home and was always very much an indoor person, so my life actually didn't change as much as everyone else's. I think that has protected me from the worst of the covid blues.
I think not sharing meals is the hardest part. There's something profoundly counterintuitive in the idea that having a long lunch with your family is one of the most dangerous things you can do. Thankfully, we're all double and triple-vaxxed by now, so that's coming back.
I'm an indoor person, and I intend to remain one. Outdoor activities are safer when it comes to covid, but it's still...outdoors.
