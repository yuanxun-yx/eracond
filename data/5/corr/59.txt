I wasn't planning to travel anyway.
I usually play games, although here in Italy people have started going out again.
I think if it's safe to go out and the law allows it, they should go out if they want to do so, but yeah, shopping online is what I like the most because of the competitive prices.
Not really, although I am not the one cooking to be honest.
Yeah I think so, just like everyone else I guess.
Not really.
It's almost winter.
