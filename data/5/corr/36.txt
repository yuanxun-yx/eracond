Yes, I have been stuck in my house for over two years now.
I mostly play games and watch TV. I also work from home so that's a plus. I've been trying to study programming, but I haven't had much success.
I think as long as you take the proper precautions then it should be fine. But yes, isolation is better.
Yes I agree, I've been cooking more at home. Before I always used to order out.
Sometimes yes, but I'm staying with awesome people so that helps take the edge off of quarantine.
Well it's very hard in tight places. But if it's family then it should be alright.
I'd like to, but where I live there's not much nature. I do unplug from technology sometimes.
