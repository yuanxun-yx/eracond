I'm traveling less because I'm worried that I might get covid. But due to university, I must travel.
I usually play video games, watch films, series, anime on Netflix, and I listen to music.
I think that shopping outside isn't dangerous unless you follow the guidelines to protect yourself. And I prefer shopping outside to online.
I think it changed because I ate more junk food. I'm also Italian so for me food is very important and I don't look at my diet.
Not really because staying at home is refreshing for me. Maybe I'm a bit antisocial.
I think it's right to feel safe, but for me it's also a little strange not to hug someone.
I think you're right, but now in November the weather isn't very beautiful to go out in, with all this rain.
