Hi, the pleasure is all mine. So, about traveling in corona times, it hasn't really been a very easy task, as not all countries are accepting tourists and not all vaccines are accepted in all countries.
Well, I'm also sorry that we have to stay so long locked in the house. I have been using this time to improve my studies. I do some Posts in the area of ​​Health, I participate in lectures and debates, I read some books that have stopped being published for some time and I bring myself up to date with series. Is that you?
Online sales actually increased considerably during this corona period. And for professionals who need to go out to work, we can only hope that they will go and return home well protected.
My diet has changed considerably. I needed to focus more on my diet, so that when I get out of this pandemic, my health will not be compromised.
Yes, which is normal. Nobody was born to be isolated for so long. The human being is a very social being and living in isolation for almost 2 years affects the psychological aspect a lot for anyone.
It is difficult, but unfortunately necessary.
Exactly. Everyone should be disconnected for half an hour a day.
