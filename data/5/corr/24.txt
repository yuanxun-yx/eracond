I agree, my last trip was cancelled because of COVID.
I play videogames and I watch TV.
I prefer online shopping as I live in a small town so yeah.
Yes, I have more time to cook but it's not that easy to find new meals each day.
It wasn't easy all the time. I really missed having a good beer in a pub during these times.
It's quite easy towards colleagues but really difficult with my family.
We had an awful summer here so I didn't go outside that much.
