I didn't travel because of covid. It's been 2 year since my last travel.
I usually read, see film and play videogames.
I think that you can't stay at home forever. If you take the proper protection you can go outside.
Yes it's changed a lot, during my free time I love experimenting new recipes.
Yes, but fortunately I live with my parents so I was not alone and I had someone to talk with.
Yes I think it's hard, some of my friends who live alone said that living alone during quarantine is really hard.
Yes I love going outside and doing sports.
