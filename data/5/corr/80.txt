That is true. I had to travel abroad for studies but I could not travel in time enough because of the covid restrictions.
Usually I play a lot of games and watch movies. However, these activities are passive and can take a toll on my mental health. I love when I am free to go wherever I want and however I want.
Shopping online is good but some people enjoy shopping more the traditional way. We just can't change them.
I am usually less concerned about food, so personally my diet is the same, but I think more people eat with less variety and options than they would like.
Yeah, sometimes. Maybe because I'm missing friends or thinking about partying.
It is hard to practice but it is necessary. The world took a different turn because of COVID and certain sacrifices have to be made.
That sounds nice. It'll definitely do some good to the body and soul.
