I wanted to travel across the country to see my parents but with the coronavirus outbreak I have been stuck at home.
Since the beginning of the quarantine I have been studying computer programming and it is my new hobby.
It is very dangerous to go shopping these days. I wish everyone would buy more online. There's no reason not to. It's so easy and quick.
My diet has gotten way worse since the beginning of the quarantine. I don't know how to cook so I just have been eating a lot of frozen food.
Yes, I feel down when I think about my family and friends. I just miss them so much.
Humans are so used to the touch of others and being always together that it has been really difficult to practice social distancing, but I am doing it.
I will be sure to try that. I think I need a little time in nature.
