Restrictions are hard, especially during the holidays. But it is necessary.
Since I was already working from home before the coronavirus, it wasn't entirely new for me.
Gloves are of little help. Wearing a mask, getting vaccinated, keeping our distance - all of this makes us safer.
Since you no longer go to restaurants, you have to create a change at home. I have cookbooks and use the Internet to do so.
No my home is my castle.
Since I do not live in a big city, there was already a lot of online contact beforehand. And if you stick to hygiene, you can meet friends too.
It's november, the sun is a rare experience.
