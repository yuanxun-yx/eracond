I have been stuck in my city since the beginning of the pandemic.
Currently just working remotely. At the beginning, I tried to do some work around the house, but it all went bad.
My online shopping habits are the same,  I think. Before the coronavirus I was shopping online almost the same.
Why are you sorry? Our diets have changed a lot, especially because the price of ingredients has increased a lot. Meat for example, almost double what it was before.
Yes, sometimes I wish to go outside and eat something different, drink a beer at a bar, or just browse stuff at the mall.
Very difficult, but right now it is necessary. And I think this is the new normal.
It will be nice, but with home working it is more difficult by the day. Also, the house needs more care with everyone in it all the time. I spend a lot of time just cleaning.
