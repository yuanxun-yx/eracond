My family and I have been plannning to travel to Orlando for two years now. We've been planning before the pandemic, but couldn't proceed due to the lockdowns.
During the pandemic I virtually had no work as a musician so I had to reinvent myself and learn some skills to start working on another job. Now I do some freelance QA testing online.
I think that going outside will not hurt as much as people believe. I mean, COVID is a new virus, but it's just a virus as all the others that interact with the human population. It is here to stay, we've got to learn to deal with it.
Yes, I follow a carnivore diet, and only consume animal products with little to no carbohydrates. Since the price of red meat has skyrocketed due to the damage the economy has taken because of the lockdowns, I can't afford to buy as much red meat as I would like or need, so I switch to consuming more eggs, chicken and pork.
Yes, I feel very depressed and anxious sometimes during the pandemic. It's like I really need to go out and meet my friends or even see some strangers.
I think that's the hardest part of the whole thing. Not being able to travel and meet family members, friends or even just going out to meet new people is very depressing and as I stated before, social distancing just won't make the virus go away. So I think that's a solution that is worst than the problem.
Yes, I have tried that and I felt way better. But the thing is, my new job requires me to stay connected to my devices a lot too. Don't get the chance to walk or do some other outside activity as much as I would want.
