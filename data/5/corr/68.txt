Neither do I, I really enjoy traveling with my husband, but in the pandemic, we couldn't, because all countries were closed.
I work on homework, when I'm not working. I go with my grandson to the beach, cook, take care of the plants.
I only shop online, but I'm not afraid to leave the house. I believe it's just protecting yourself. I go everywhere I want.
No, because since I'm the one who eats, I always do different things.
Definitely, because it's great to receive friends, visit our parents, our children. And to be banned from leaving the house, it gives despair.
Yes, social distancing is very difficult, especially for me who loves kissing and hugging friends, families.
It's hard for me to distance myself from technology, but I walk every day by the sea. So for 2 hours I stay away from technology.
