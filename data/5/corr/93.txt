Hi! I had to postpone my trip to the US three times since the pandemic started...
I usually watch Netflix. I love real crime docuseries. Or play games like animal crossing on my Nintendo Switch.
Shopping online is great! Before the pandemic I was already adept at shopping online and now it is all I do. the only downside is having to wait until the product arrives =(
Not really. My diet changed because my husband and I went to see a nutritionist, he wanted to lose weight, I wanted to gain.
Actually, I've been feeling really good! I started seeing a therapist and taking medicine for my anxiety and having my husband around all the time actually made our relationship even stronger.
Very hard, I like to hug the people I love!
I go on walks with my husband so we can talk and get out for a while.
