Hi, nice talking to you too! Since I'm a student I am allowed to travel from my home city and the city where I study with few restrictions.
I love reading, watching TV series, attending online courses about different topics and listening to music.
Shopping online is a good solutions to avoid spreading covid but I feel like it pushes us to buy more, even when we don't need to.
My mom is an excellent cook so eating at home is always great. My diet hasn't changed during covid.
Honestly, I prefer staying alone rather than spending time with other people so I don't feel depressed.
It is hard. Emotional proximity always defeats social distance.
I actually meditate everyday but thanks for the advice!
