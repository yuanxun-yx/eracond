Hi! It's nice to chat :)
I'm a musician so I spend most of the day playing instruments, recording and writing.
Yeah, I think shopping more online is the best choice. Safer and faster!
Yes it has changed a bit. Also because I had more time to think about it and to choose a safer diet.
I actually felt very good! I did many things and worked on many projects with friends around the world.
Yeah it is quite strange, but luckily we are heading to an end of social distancing. In the UK for example they don't have restrictions anymore.
I do that every day and I love it :)
