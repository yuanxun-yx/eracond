Hi, yes I used to travel a lot for my job but now we are not allowed to travel anymore if it's not business critical.
Yes, I've been practising my juggling skills a lot! What do you do in your time at home?
It's the same here, but I still prefer to shop for groceries in person.
It remained pretty much the same. I don't care much about food.
Who hasn't?
Italians tend to hug and kiss everytime they meet and I've never liked it. So I'm not putting much effort into avoiding close physical contact. It's harder for kids.
I do a walk everyday first thing in the morning. It helps a lot.
