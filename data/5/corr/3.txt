I prefer not to do it, because it's not safe.
I work online so, I use my time wisely and on the other hand, it's a good time to spend with family, because usually you know, we need go to work and there's not much time to spare.
I agree, it's for us and our family's safety. Many people are too greedy, so they don't care about others, even their own family...
I think it's better, because I have the time to prepare more elaborate food, and so more time to delight than usual.
Never, my only worry sometimes is to have no more work.
Really, really hard as you said with the family first and with the close friends. I have not seen my friends since one and a half years ago.
That sounds great, maybe I will try someday, because I have more time as I said before.
