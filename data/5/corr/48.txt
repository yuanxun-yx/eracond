Hello, nice talking to you too. I heard the same.
I like to read and watch movies and TV, but while in confinement I did try to pick up new skills.
I don't think there's too much of a problem going outside, if you're careful to stay safe with masks and hand sanitizer. And of course, getting the vaccine.
Only inasmuch as I've started stress eating a couple of times.
I did, lots of times. 
I agree, it's very hard. I miss hugging my friends.
Sure. As long as you take your mask.
