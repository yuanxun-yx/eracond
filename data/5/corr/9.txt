Hello, nice to talk to you too. Pandemic has changed my life, I am staying inside and trying to protect my parents.
I play videogames and I like to work online, Amazon mturk has saved my life during these pandemic times.
I agree with you, we can shop almost everything online nowdays, no need to risk our lives and our loved ones.
Yes, my diet is really poor right now. I am overweight because I can't go to gym anymore.
A little yes, I miss hanging out with my friends, watching movies in the cinema. Life is boring at home.
I am a shy person, so that is not a big problem for me, but I would like to walk again without a mask.
Yeah there's nothing like the smell of the nature.
