Yeah, I have heard the same. I had a visa cancelled due to COVId
I model characters in clay, draw on my iPad, play lots of games and watch series and movies. What do you do?
I love shopping online, but for some things, it's best to go in person, like clothing. Sometimes you have to try them on. 
Yes, because of COVID.
Yes, quite a lot. I developed depression during this last year, but it was not due to quarantine. It was because I feel lonely after my divorce, and I am struggling with financial problems.
I think it's hard for people in general to practice it, but for me it was easy, since I was never a person who likes to go out often or that gathers with friends every week...
I wish I could do that but I always sleep during the day and stay up during the night, and I have no space to practice gardening...
