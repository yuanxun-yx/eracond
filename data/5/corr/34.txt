Me too, now there are a lot of difficulties, each country has its own rules, and I must take a Corona test everytime I need to travel.
Watching TV, series, read books.
Yes it's more safe to stay home and do shopping online, but we are human. We need to have real contact. Also there are some products such as shoes and clothes which I prefer to try them before I buy them to get the right size.
I lost control.
Yes I do.
Yes it's hard to practice it with family and friends.
I do 3 times a week, it's really important.
