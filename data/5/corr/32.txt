That is true for me too. I don't travel much anyway but would like to visit my brother. But I'm hesitant to do so.
Reading books and manga, watching anime, writing stories and programming mostly.
Online shopping is very convenient and especially good for a pandemic, but sometimes shopping in person is necessary.
Mine hasn't changed much, but yes unless I am ordering Hello Fresh, it is not very diverse.
Not more than usual I would say. I guess it does cause negative feelings but usually doesn't lower my general mood.
Yeah once you sit together, it is hard to keep to the rules.
Well sadly it is winter by now, but I should spend more time outside anyway I suppose.
