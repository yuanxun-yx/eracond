Hi! Yes the pandemic left us all stranded. Literally many borders are still closed and traveling makes the virus contamination more real. I believe this spread started that way through international travel.
Yes it is something very sad! But on the other hand there are some positive points such as nowadays I can spend more time with my family and I continue with my physical activities at home, and I am also learning several courses such as digital marketing, English, all online.
Yes, I fully agree. Yes, we must adhere to online shopping, leave the house only in urgent cases, for example, going to the doctor. And the mask is not 100% effective, so we must take all possible care.
For sure, but what I do, I'm learning new recipes on the Internet and my diet has changed, because now I'm also ordering a lot of snacks, such as a McDonalds snack.
Yes I feel depressed at times. We never experienced this being stuck indoors without physical contact with friends, family and coworkers.
Too hard because human beings are not isolated people. Talking about myself, it's too hard to stay away from those we love and like and even more without a perspective on when all this will end or when it will return to normal.
I agree it is fundamental even to reflect on our life.
