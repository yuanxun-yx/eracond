Yeah, me too.
I spend more time with my children.
I agree with you, I am doing more shopping online than going out. It's more safe.
You know, now with more idle time, I am trying new recipes that I see online.
Yes I do, and I try not to overthink about this situation, and I have hope that we're going back to our normal life again soon.
Yes, it's so hard to stay away from my mom, but we need to do it, as a proof of our love and care. We used to chat a lot in a video call.
Yeah you're right, this is a good advice, thanks.
