Yeah! It is a bad period for every human on earth. To fill my free time I usually read webtoons or watch good drama but I also enjoy jogging. I have a treadmill at home so I can still enjoy a good run, and I have also bought some yoga equipment to stay fit.
I think it's true that people are shopping more online than in real shops and I also think this is a natural evolution given that we live in the digital era. COVID just sped up this process. But I don't think that we should only use online shopping. The best part of buying stuff is also touching them and seeing them in a set environment. That's the joy of shopping.
Yes, my diet has changed drastically. I don't know if it is because of the forced staying home or because with age I have become more anxious, but I have gastritis so I don't eat much. I can't eat lettuce or fatty food.
