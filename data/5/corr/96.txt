Now I can travel to some countries opened to Brazilians with a vaccine passport, which is my case. But unless I have to, I do not intend to travel so soon.
I am an avid reader so I read, let´s say 70% of my leisure time, and watch series and movies the other 30%. I also have a home office job now and that keeps me busy. All my meals I prepare myself and that was fantastic, awesome because I could take better care of my nutrition. I lost 40 pounds which I needed for such a long time and could only accomplish in this quarantine situation that I and the rest of the country were forced into.
No doubt. If you expose yourself your likelihood to get covid-19 is huge. It is easy to get contaminated and pose a risk not only to yourself but also to the people around you. I really do not understand that people could be so careless about other people´s lives. To go to the shopping mall is more important than life itself? Of course not! But some people are careless even though. Shame on these people!
No doubt it changed, and for the better. I choose more conscientiously the ingredients, preferring those more natural and with low calories count. It has been a lot of fruits, vegetables, salad, lean meats like chicken breast and fish. I also started to exercise finding a training online that I love now and do it almost every day.
Not really because I work from home and do not live alone. I have a son and my wife at home. We get along really well us 3 and do almost everything together like cooking, cleaning the house, gardening and watching movies. It´s been nice !!
Yes, it is a bit hard. STOP
