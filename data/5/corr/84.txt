I've also heard that many countries are restricting flights because of Covid19.
I'm watching a lot of series on Netflix. Because of the pandemic I am staying at home a lot.
I think your concern is legitimate as the new coronavirus is very dangerous. And your engineering friends should all shop online to avoid contamination.
Definitely my diet has changed a lot. In my case, the diet changed for the better, as before the pandemic I only ate bad food in restaurants. Now, with the new coronavirus, I am staying more at home and making my own healthy food.
Yes, sometimes during the day I feel sad for not being able to leave the house, but soon I get in touch with my family on the internet and my joy returns.
I think social distancing is very difficult. I understand how people are sad about it, but our lives are so much more important. And I'm sure this pandemic will end.
