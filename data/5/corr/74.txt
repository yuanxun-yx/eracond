Hi! It's nice to talk with you too! This is true. I couldn't travel for almost two years.
I usually watch TV (TV shows, movies), read, and stay with my children.
I love shopping online and during the pandemic time, I increased my habit.
Unfortunately, my diet now is worse than before Covid 19. I feel always too tired to cook.
Yes. I fell down right now.
At first I did social distancing and I was really worried about my friends that didn't do it. But now, I'm vaccinated and all my family is too, so we are closer now.
Yes. You're right. I need to spend my time doing outdoor activities. It will be good for my health.
