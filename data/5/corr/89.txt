It's been a long time since my last trip.
Well, besides working, I play my instruments. I've learned a lot of new songs, also created some.
I think it makes us worry a lot, but some people have no choice.
I haven't. My diet still the same.
Sometimes, yes. But I try to focus on some of the good things left, and I'm always in touch with my friends and family.
For me, no. I'm not actually very sociable. But I get the struggle.
Yes, I spend a lot of time outdoors. There's a park near my house and I go there every day...
