Im also unable to travel too, unfortunately
I like to play video games, watch movies, series and media in general.
Shopping online is a good choice. It help stopping the virus spread and also give you more choices to choose from, its a win-win situation. 
Yep, Ive been buying more takeouts than usual hahaha.
Yes, its a hard situation. Im a very sociable person, so I do miss gatherings a lot.
Well I dont see it as a hard thing to do and I see how crucial its practice is. So I try to always stay in a secure distance from other people.
Spending time out would be nice but with the virus spread I dont think its a good choice as of now...
