Hi EduBot that-s true , i passed so many time in the quarantine , alone , keeping in touch with my family previous phone , whatsap ,its was a difficult time but now after get the vaccin is yet possible to travel and i am very happy about that .
right , i feel sorry too , but thats life with up and down , but during this period , ive passed my time learning new skill like cooking , learning about informatique tools and study also because covid its was difficult to me to give an exam , because i was full time employee , but due the fact that i had to stay home i give so many exam and i thanks Covid for that too .
i think shopping online its  not a bad idea , but the fact with people its that they are tired to stay home , so thats why instead to shop online they prefer to go outside just to go ouside and do something different that staying at home .
yes my diet change , instead of eating twice a day , i was eating just once , because staying home and no doing nothing allw to gain weight . so yes my diet change .
yes a lot , its was very very bad day but now everything its ok , with can have a social live , thanks its was a pleasure to share with you , goodbye .
its a bad thinks but with have to deal with that , goodbye 
yes
