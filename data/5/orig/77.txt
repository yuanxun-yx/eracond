Me too, its very sad! I would love to go to Ireland this Christmas.
I love reading and writing, I really enjoy books. What about you?
Its true, on the other end it is also important to support local shops, who are having a hard time lately...
Luckily not: my partner is very good at cooking so he can always find new interesting ideas for us1
Yes, I felt down a lot during the longest period of quarantine. Luckily I had the support of my partner. I was pregnant at the time. What about you?
Its surely hard among couples, if they dont live together. But I dont find it hard with friends, Im just happy to have the chance to see them and have a chat...
I do a lot of yoga, as self care practice! What do you do? Do you practice some sport?
