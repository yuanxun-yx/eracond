IM travelling less because im worried that i might get covid, but due to university i must travel 
I usually play videogames, watch film, series, anime on netflix and i listen to music
I think that shopping outside isnt dangerous unless you follow the guidelines to pretect yourself, and i prefer shopping outside than online
I think it changed because i ate more junk food , im also italian so for me food is very important and i dont look at the diet
Not really beacuse stayinbg at home is refreshing for me, maybeim a bit antisocial
I think is right to feel safe, but for me too is a little strange not to hug someone 
i think youre right, but now in november the weather isnt very beautiful to go out, with all this rain
