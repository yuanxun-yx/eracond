Ye, me too
I spend more time with my children
I agree with you, I am doing more shopping online than going out, is more safe
you know, now with more time idle I am trying new recipes that I see online
yes I do, and I try dont overthink about this situation and I have hope that were going to back to our normal life again soon
yes is so hard to stay away of my mom, but  we need to do it, as a prove of our love and care about, we use to chat alot in a video call
yeah youre right this is a good advice, thanks
