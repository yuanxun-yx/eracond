Hi, nice talking to you too! Since Im a student, Im allowed to travel with almost no restrictions. Of course, I have to wear mask and keep social distance but at least I can visit my family often and go to university in a different city to study
Oh I feel like Ive libed a lockdown for my entire life! I love reading books, listen to music, watch tv series and attending online courses on different topics
Of course shopping online is a good idea because of covid but I feel like its easier to shop online thus we consume more
Oh my mom is an excellent cook so even during the lockdown my diet hasnt changed
Honestly I always prefer staying alone than spending time with other people so I dont feel depressed
Yes it is hard, emotional proximity beats social distance
I already meditate every day but thanks for the advice!
