Luckily im traveling around in Europe, i like to discover new places
I play videogames, watch tv, work when possible, stay with family
I prefer shopping outside, its always better seeing the real product before buying it
Its kinda always the same, i havent changed my diet
Every day, its not easy to be forced inside the house
Its not hard, but its not always possible, especially in small places
It sounds like a great advice!
