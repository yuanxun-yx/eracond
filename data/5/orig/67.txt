i didnt travel because of covid. Its 2 year since my last travel
i usually read, see film and play videogames
i think that you cant stay ay home forever, if you take the proprer protection you can go outside
yess its changed a lot, during my free time i love experimenting new recepits
yes, but fortunately i live with my parents so i was not alone and i had someone to talk with
yes i think its hard, some of my friends who live alone said that living alone during quarantine its really hard
yesss I love going outside and doing sport
