Hi, nice talking to you too! Since Im a student I am allowed to travel from my home city and the city where I study with few restrictions 
I love reading, watching tv series, attending online courses about different topics and listening to music
Shopping online is a good solutions to avoid spreading covid but I feel like it pushes us to buy more, even when we dont need to
My mom is an excellent cook so eating at home is always great, my diet hasnt changed during covid
Honestly I prefer staying alone rather than spending time with other people so I dont feel depressed
It is hard, emotional proximity always defeats social distance
I actually meditate everyday but thanks for the advice!
