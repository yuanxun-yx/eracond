It is true. In my case, I was confined at home for a period of three months.
Actually, I was fortunate because I could work at home, so I did not have much time to spare. I don´t like cooking at all and I don´t have a garden so cooking and gardening were out of the question. I just tried to relax and chill out after work
It depends on who you ask. Myself, I prefer go shopping whenever is possible.  Online shopping is also an option to buy things abroad or that you cannot get easily in your town.
Not really. As I told you before I don´t apreciate the art of cuisine very much so I pretty stick to the same dishes, that is: pasta, rice and mediterranean food 
It was difficult sometimes, yes. I live alone and not being able to feel the presence of someone is a bit hard to endure. 
Most defenitely, specially latin people. We are so close, with a preference for touching and being in group every day. However, everybody must make the effort to follow the rules, otherwhise this situation will be out of our hands to control
I believe a lot of people realised that when they were confined. Spending time outdoors with a nice weather and sunshine, just walking, is a good way to relax and forget about everyday problems.
