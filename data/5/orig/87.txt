i was never able to travel a lot, since im stuck in Venezuela due to a severe fuel crisis. How about you? 
Im in love with cooking, I like to cook all kinds of meats and deserts. Do yo like deserts?
I think only shopping has its advantages, If i could i would shop online more often
my diet has stayed moslty the same, since I cook mostly the same
I dont, since Im a computer mouse like my mom used to say, Im used to staying home more time than most of people, so im quite good
not for me, ive always been a distant person, lets say I enjoy being with myself, however i can see that this situation could affect people who are extremely sociable or are very attached to their relatives
Well, lucky me, i live in an apartment but we have a pool so I go swimming a couple days a week, that way I can get out of confinement
