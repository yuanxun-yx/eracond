Currently I am only planing vacations in my home country, but I really would like to travel abroad again.
Surfing aimlessly in the internet.
You should still get out somewhere. Staying home 100% isnt good for your mental health.
My diet hasnt changed much, but I love experimenting with new recipes. 
I am introvert, so and I believe I can adjust to this situation better than orhers,
I havent seen some close relatives in while. Thats kind of hard, indeed.
Oh, I go mountain biking when the weather is right.
