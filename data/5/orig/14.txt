Hello. Yes, that is really happening with me too. But, I travelled last week for the first time in the pandemic.
I usually do nothing, in these pandemic moment I used to rest a lot.
I agree with you. It is better shopping online and avoid always possible get out for physical shopping.
Yes, my diet changed a lot. My diet actually is really not healthy and I need to change it soon. Because, it not good for healthy eating a lot fast food for example.
Im not soo sad staying at home because Im not in a good moment in my life. I was diagnosed with burnout syndrome. 
I think we are humans and it is important to have social contact. But, in these moment I dont think is it hard we learned that is better for our health. 
I totally agree with you. I need try that more, and walk around a little bit. Because, staying at home all the time is not good for body and mental health.
