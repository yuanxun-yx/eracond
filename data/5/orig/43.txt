Hi! yes the pandemic left us all stranded literally many borders are still closed and traveling makes the virus contamination more real I believe this spread started that way through international travel
yes it is something very sad! but on the other hand there are some positive points such as nowadays I can spend more time with my family and I continue with my physical activities at home and I am also learning several courses such as digital marketing, English, all online
yes, I fully agree, yes, we must adhere to online shopping, leave the house even only in urgent cases, for example, going to the doctor and the mask is not 100% effective, so we must take all possible care
for sure, but what i do, im learning new recipes on the internet and my diet has changed, because now im also ordering a lot of snacks, such as a mc donalds snack
yes i feel depressed at times we never experienced this being stuck indoors without physical contact with friends family coworkers
too hard because human beings are not isolated people I talk about myself too hard to stay away from those we love and like and even more without a perspective on when all this will end it will return to normal
I agree it is fundamental even to reflect on our life
