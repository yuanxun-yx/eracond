Hi there, we were having a conversation  a moment ago. how do you feel? I am pretty pissed off from being frustrated in my desire to have a trip
I like to cook, watch movies and listen to the radio. I also love to spend time with my famil
I did a lot of purchases online during this pandemic. I was pretty scared at the beginning, so I have almost stopped going to shops in person, but now I feel more secure.m
Yes, I gained pounds. Ive eaten too much cause I was so damn bored, you know. 
Yes, but my family always gives me purposes to wake up and doing stuff. I cannot stop, even for one second
Not so much. It is better in this way. Its too dangerous, and we will be together again in the near future
You know what? You are right, I should take more care of myself as an individual and spend more time outside. Thanks
