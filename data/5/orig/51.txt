Im also unable to travel too, unfortunately
Usually I play video games, watch movies, series and midia in general
Yes youre right but still somethings cant be bought online because people need satisfaction about the product they are buying
I dont think so well I think its good because at home we cook the food ourselves and its an healthy activity and we get healthy food
Yes its a bit depressing but what else we can do about it? 
Its a hard thing for everyone because no one knew this can happen! Well we have to face it anyway it is for our own good
Absolutely! We all meed a break from it and refresh ourselves
