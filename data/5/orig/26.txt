Yeah, I have heard the same. I had a visa cancelled due to COVId
I model characters in clay, draw on my ipad, play lots of games and watch series and movies, what do you do?
I love shopping online, but for some things, its best to go in person, like clothing. Sometimes you have to try them on. 
Yes, cause with COD
Yes, quite a lot. I developed depression during this last year, but it was not due to quarantine, it was because i feel lonely after my divorce, and i am struggling with financial problems 
I think its hard for people in general to practice it, but for me it was easy, since i was never a person who likes to go out often or that gather with friends every week...
I wish i could do that but i always sleep during the day and stay up during the night, and i have no space to practice gardening...
