hi, yes I used to travel a lot in my job but now we are not allowed to travel anymore if its not business critical.
yes, Ive been practising my juggling skills a lot! what do you do in your time at home?
its the same here, but I stll prefer to shop for groceries in person
it remained pretty much the same. I dont care much about food
who hasnt?
Italians tend to hug and kiss everytime they meet and Ive never like it. So Im not doing much effort to avoid close physical contact. its harder for kids
I do a walk everyday as first thing in the morning. It helps a lot
