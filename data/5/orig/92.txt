Hi nice to meet you! I used to travel for work and now its all stopped up...
Usually I just relax scrolling facebook or watching Netflix series, nothing special!
I think if precautions are maintained and we all get vaccinated, we need to start living again!
I could say my diet didnt change, but since I work from home now, I rarely have time to spend time cooking and this affected my diet as well...
I really feel down staying at home all the time. I wish I could come back at the office more often.
Yes, I think its quite hard especially because people want to start living again!
Very good suggestions, thank you for that. I will try to follow them... :)
