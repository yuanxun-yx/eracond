Yeah, the closest international border is closed.
I work from home, so sometimes I just work more in my spare time. If I dont feel like working or doing chores, I watch TV, read, or listen to podcasts.
I think shopping is mostly a safe activity. Little to no prolonged interaction with anyone, most people mask up where I live, and vaccination rates are high.
Yup, my diet has changed. Not eating outside meant I could watch what I eat and actually weigh everything and do calorie counting, I actually lost a lot of weight. I also did try to figure new ingredients into my cooking -- marinading chicken in yogurt is a new family favorite.
Sure, who doesnt. But I already worked from home and was always very much an indoor person, so my life actually didnt change as much as everyone elses. I think that has protected me from the worst of the covid blues.
I think not sharing meals is the hardest part. Theres something profoundly counterintuitive in the idea that having a long lunch with your family is one of the most dangerous things you can do. Thankfully, were all double and triple-vaxxed by now, so thats coming back.
Im an indoor person, and I intend to remain one. Outdoor activities are safer when it comes to covid, but its still... outdoors.
