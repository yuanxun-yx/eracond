Well, Im from Italy and I can travell to the whole European Union inven though its not advisable
Not much. Im a student so I just study or watch some tv shows. Sometimes I work out.
I dont think they should shop online more time. I dont like it very much. People can shop outside hovewer they should be carefull
Not that much. Maybe I eat a bit less than before, but thats because Im a bit lazy sometimes
yes but thats not because of the virus
Not for me. Im not that kind of person who usualy touch or talk really close to people
Well the weather here is not that good. Its raining right now. I dont think my problem will go away by unplugging for 30 minutes internet. But i appreciate the suggestion
