Me neither, unfortunately. Things are so difficult right now.
Ive been spending time with my family.
I totally agree. Online shopping is far safier indeed.
Not at all. Im eating the same things as before actually.
Not due to the quarantine itself, but things have been difficult lately.
I think its difficult, but its extremely important.
I try to do that, but Ive been having not a lot of free time lately.
