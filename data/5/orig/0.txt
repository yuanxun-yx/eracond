I too have stopped traveling. too afraid of being infected
staying at home I watch many TV series, play with my children, cook many new things and do a lot of physical activity. I have to fill in the days in a fruitful way
I too hate those who do not take precautions. Many do not have to protect themselves. thats why this virus doesnt want to pass. too many unconscious people
since I am most at home I have bought many frozen products, in order to always have stocks at home. I try to vary my diet and that of my children as much as possible. It wont be fresh but at least and varied
sometimes I saw my children bored and then I tried to invent games and entertain them. Staying at home makes you sad, especially on nice days
staying away from friends, family members is very difficult. Thanks to the video calls I tried not to miss too much. but the desire to embrace them is great
the walks in the open air are beautiful. With the spacing I tried to do as much as possible.
