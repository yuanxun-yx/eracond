yeah! thats true. covid has caused alot of inconvenience that people cant move around as before. 
relaxin, working from home and ive had a lot of time to bond with my kids.
yea, i myself prefer online shopping. if i can get something online there is no need for me to go out.
it has definately changed since now that am home i find myself eating healthy.
it is kind of depressing but you get used to it with time. boredom comes when you want to go out with friends but you cant. 
it is hard because at some point you will find yourself getting close to them or touching the same things they do without even noticing.
thats a great idea. am looking forward on doing that
