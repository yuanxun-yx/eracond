My family and I have been plannning to travel to orlando for two years now. Weve begin planning before the pandemic, but couldnt proceed due to the lockdowns.
During the pandemic I virtually had no work as a musician so I had to reinvent myself and learn some skills to start working on another job. Now I do some freelance QA testing online.
I think that going outside will not hurt as much as people believe, I mean, COVID is a new virus, but is just a virus as all the other that interact with the human population. It is here to stay, weve got to learn to deal with it.
Yes, I follow a carnivore diet, and only consume animal products with little to no carbohydrates. Since the price of red meat has skyrocketed due to the damage the economy has taken because of the lockdowns, I cant afford to buy as much red meat as I would like or need, so I switch to consuming more eggs, chicken and pork.
Yes, I feel very depressed and anxious sometimes during the pandemic. Its like I really need to go out and meet my friends or even see some strangers.
I think thats the hardest part of the whole thing. Not being able to travel and meet family members, friends or even just going out to meet new people is very depressing and I as I stated before, social distancing just wont make the virus go away. So I think thats a solution that is worst than the problem.
Yes, Ihave tried that and I felt way better. But the thing is, my new job requires me to stay connected to my devices a lot so. dont get the chance to walk or do some other outside activity as much as I would want
