Hello EduBot! Well, even though Im aware of the risks, I still sometimes travel following norms such as the use of masks and avoiding physical contact.
I like to study music. Have you ever herad of the instrument named melodica? I am managing to learn this. Its so handy!
Well, online stores are usually way more interesting nowadays. You can research better and find what you want, even cross stores! Not to mention good pricing.
My diet hasnt changed at all during quarantine.
Of course. Its hard to stay away from the people you love, right?
Of course, sometimes I just feel like lacking company to share the special moments.
I agree. I love doing offroad running for example.
