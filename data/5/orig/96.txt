Now I can travel to some countries opened to brazilians with a vaccine passport, which is my case but unless I have to I do not intend to travel so soon.
I am an avid reader so I read, let´s say 70% of my leasure time and watch series and movies the other 30%. I also have a home office job now and that keeps me busy. Al my meals I prepare myself and that was fantastic, awesome because I could take better care of my nutrition. I lost 40 pounds which I needed for so long time and could only accomplish in these quarantine situation me and the rest of the country was forced to.
no doubt, if you expose yourself your likelyhood to get covid-19 is huge. It is easy to get contaminated and pose a risk not only to yourself but also to the people around you. I really do not understand that people could be so careless about other people´s lives. To go to the shopping mall is more important than lfe itself? Of course not but some people are cereless even thought. Shame on these people!
no doubt it changed and for the better. I choose more consciously the ingredients prefering those more natural and with low calories count. It has been a lot of fruits, vegetables, salad, lean meats like chicken breast and fish. I also started to exercise finding a trainning on line that I love now and do it almost every day.
Not really because I work from home and do not live alone. I have a son and my wife at home. We get along really well us 3 and do almost everything together like cooking, cleaning the house, gardening and watching movies. It´s been nice !!
yes it is a bit hard. STOP
