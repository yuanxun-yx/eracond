I wasnt planning to travel anyway
I usually play games, although here in Italy people have started going out again
I think if it safe to go out and the law allows it, they should go out if they want to do so, but yeah, shopping online is what i like the most because of the competitive prices
Not really, although I am not the one cooking to be honest
Yeah I think so, just like everyone else i guess
not really
Its almost winter
