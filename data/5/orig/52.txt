I havent travelled yet since the first lockdown, but Im planning to start  the next winter in a big city
In my free time I watch a Lo of TV series in English language, so I can improve my listening skills. I also like cooking when I dont have anything else to do, and my favorite receipts are the cakes and cheescakes ones
I think that online shopping is easy and convenient but it is very different from buying in the shops, because for example, you can see if the clothes suits on  you and if the matter is fine 
My diet hasnt changed at all, but unfortunately Im eating more than before. Im concerned about the clothes that wont fit me well
No, I feel quiet and relaxes because Idoing everything at home
