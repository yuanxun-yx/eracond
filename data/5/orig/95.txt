Hi! I dont think there are as many restrictions as before now.
I play videogames, read a book, watch TV or videos on YouTube, I paint or play boardgames.
I guess it would be better especially if you are not vaccinated, but if youre wearing a mask and disinfect your hands frequently you should be fine.
No, I didnt change my diet. Did you?
No, Im an introvert and Ive always enjoyed staying at home to dedicate time to my hobbies.
It shouldnt be that hard to put in practice, especially if you think about the potential consequences of not practicing it. I mean, you wouldnt want to risk infecting your close friends or family members, right?
Yeah it would be great if it wasnt already pretty cold as we are in the middle of november.
