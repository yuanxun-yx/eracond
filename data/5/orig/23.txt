Oh in fact. Its been so difficult to travel
Actually Ive been working full time, so there isnt a lot of free time available anyway.
I completely agree with you. People have been so reckless, right?
I dont think so, but Ive learned to cook some new things in fact.
Sometimes. Its so surreal what weve been passing through, right?
It was very hard during the first months, not so much anymore.
I actually agree, even though its so much difficult to unplug from everything due to work.
