Restrictions are hard, especially during the holidays. But it is necessary.
since I was already working from home before the coronavirus, it wasnt entirely new for me
gloves are of little help. Wearing a mask, getting vaccinated, keeping our distance - all of this makes us safer.
since you no longer go to restaurants, you have to create a change at home. i have cookbooks and use the internet to do so
no my home is my castle
since i do not live in a big city, there was already a lot of online contact beforehand. and if you stick to hygiene, you can meet friends too
its november, the sun is a rare experience
