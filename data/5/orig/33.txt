Hey, I dont travel that much, just for work and so far so good.
I usually read books, ebooks, play videogmaes, play piano and guitar. Music is my passion.
Yes, indeed. Its not safe. I prefer stay at home and I say the same to my parents and friends. Its hard but we have to do it.
No, my diet is the same. Fortunately I can buy all my stuff in my local shops. I can go there by foot. The problem is not what I eat but how much I eat.
Sometimes. I fill depressed several times in the years and quaratine didnt change my routine. 
Yes, I do. But after almost 2 years Im used to. Its sad to say that but its the truth.
I spend lot of time outside. Im a cyclist and I love nature.
