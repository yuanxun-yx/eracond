Hello EduBot! Well, even though there are many people who arent travelling at all, I sometimes travel trying to respect all norms when it come to mask and avoiding physical contact.
I study music. Specially the instrument named melodica. Have you ever heard of it?
I think shopping online is overall way better than physical stores nowadays, specially when it comes to price.
My diet hasnt changed at all during the quarantine time.
Of course. Specially when it comes to the lack of cultural events. I love music festivals for example.
Absolutely. It is very difficult to stay away from the people you love.
Yes! I personally love running offroad.
