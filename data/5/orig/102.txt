hi there. Yeah, you are right. The same here. I am not having so much travels right now and this is pretty annoying
Yeah, youve got this point. I have spent a lot of time watching movies and gathering more knowledge in some fields. I love cooking, playing games and listening to the radio
During this pandemic I did a lot of web shopping. Especially back at the beginning of the pandemic, I did a lot of online purchases. But as long as the situation is getting better, I fell more safe now in going shopping in real life.
Nah. I am an Italian guy, thus my diet is sacred to me. We spend a lot of time cooking and also thinking about our food. By the way, I have gained some kilos during this last year, maybe you are right
Not so much, fortunately. My son gives me all the purposes that I need in order to keep going. You know, children are the best anti-depressant possible. What about you? What did you do during the pandemic? 
Yeah, of course. But fortunately, I live with my wife and my son, thus I was never by my self during this period. This period should be used by people to improve themselves, but I think this is a mere dream. 
Lol, you are a boss. You know what? You are right, I will. This is a simple as wise advice to follow. Its been a while since I dont cut with the technologies and have a break
