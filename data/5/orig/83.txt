I had tickets to travel in the first months of the pandemic and I had to cancel the trip.
I tried not to get bored in the leisure space, watching movies and series, reading books or playing video games.
If I made purchases online, but not exaggeratedly, more or less what I did before. At the beginning of the pandemic, I was a little more scared, because it was a totally new experience.
If I change a little, try trying new recipes and different flavors to try not to feel so much the absence of eating in the street.
Well, in my case, no, between all the remote work that I could do and the housework, the day passed quickly.
It is hard, but there is no other choice. It is better to keep your distance than to risk catching it and then infecting your loved ones.
Yes, I think it is a good option, meditating outdoors also de-stresses you a lot.
