Neither do I, I really enjoy traveling with my husband, but in the pandemic, we couldnt, because all countries were closed.
I work at homework, when Im not working, I go with my grandson to the beach, cook, take care of the plants.
I only shop online, but Im not afraid to leave the house, I believe its just protecting yourself. I go everywhere I want.
No, because since Im the one who eats, I always do different things.
Definitely, because its great to receive friends, visit our parents, our children and be banned from leaving the house, it gives despair.
Yes, social distancing is very difficult, especially for me who love kissing and hugging friends, families.
Its hard for me to distance myself from technology, but I walk every day by the sea. So for 2 hours I stay away from technology.
