me too, now there are alot of difficulties, each country have there own rules, and i must make Corona test everytime i need travel.
watching Tv, series, read books.
yes its more safe to stay home and do shopping online, but we are human, we need to have real contact, also there are some products such as shoes and clothes which i prefer to try them before i buy them to get the right size.
i lost control.

yes its hard to practice it with family and friends.
i do 3 times a week, its really important.
