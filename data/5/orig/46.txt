Hi, nice to meet you, Thats really is painfull, Staying inside, but its for our good
I like to play video games, watch some anime and series, I try to make money from home too
Shop online probaly is the best thing for our century, internet make everything more easy
Yes, I am a bit of overweight right now, and my diet is really poor, I think because we are staying inside more, we eat more of junk food
A little, but i try to focus my mind on things that i liked, live my games and animes
Not for me, I was always shy, so distancing to people was always a fact in my life
Yeah theres nothing better to that smell of the nature right, going walk on a park, etc
