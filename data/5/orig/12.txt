Hello nice talking to you. Actually I was not planning to travel this year so it is not directling impacting my trips.
I love gardening and jogging. I am luck to be able to practice this 2 hobbies even during the worst phases of Covid pandemic. 
For sure I agree with you. I have tried to shop online as much as possible even for groceries. I am leaving for shops just when it is really urgent. Do you think there should be more strict rules for physical shopping these days?
Yes for sure. Several ingredientes that I used before were not available during several months of pandemic. I had to find new ways for cooking and have to restrict my diet to fewer options.
For sure yes. Even more seeing the news with really bad newsit was impossible not feeling depressed. But at the end of the day I realized that all this suffering is something real and happened even before Covid.
For sure it is and it is ever harder for childs but I think it was really necessary during the initial phase.
Thanks a lot for the tips. I will try to do so.
