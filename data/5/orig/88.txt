Hi! Nice to meet you. Well its a good question, I agree that travelling is getting harder because of restrictions due to covid pandemic. I used to travel for work and now its all stopped up
I usually just relax scrolling facebook or watching netflix series
I think that if you keep precautions and avoid crowded places, there is no issue in going out
Its not changed, but since I work from home I rarely have the time to cook during lunch time and thats bad. I could say my diet didnt change but my habits did
I really feel down staying at home all the day, I wish I could work at the office more often
I think it is hard, luckily all my closest friends and parents are vaccinated
Thank you for your advices, I definetly need to do something like that, especially unplug from technology :)
