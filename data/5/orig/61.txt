In fact, I have been planning to travel to Orlando with my family for two years now. We started that plan before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Actually during the pandemic I had to learn new skills and get. a new job, since as a former musician, my chances of working diminished greatly during the pandemic.
I think that the virus will spread no matter what. I mean, its another virus as the other ones that entered the human interaction. Masks and lockdowns wont stop it and staying at home will only damage the economy.
Yes, I follow a carnivore diet now, and only consume animal products with little to no carbohydrates. But since the price of red meat has skyrocketed due to the crash on the economy because of the lockdown, I couldnt afford as much red meat as I want and need so I had to switch to consuming more eggs, chicken and pork.
Yes, I often few depressed and anxious during the pandemic. Its like I need to see my friends or even strangers to feel more "alive".
Its very hard. I feel thats the hardest part of the whole pandemic, not being able to meet with my friends, to go on a movie theater, or a concert...Its very sad.
I have tried that and in fact, I feel a lot better when I do it, but my job now involves being on my devices almost all the time
