Hi, its good to talk to you too, its true, covid has prevented many people from traveling because countries have closed borders.
What you said is very applicable!, because of the pandemic I developed the hobby of reading and I am enjoying it a lot!
Buying online is perfect, you dont need to risk getting infected and you can do it from your bed if you want.
My diet has changed a lot since the beginning of the pandemic, I used to cook more, but now Im ordering my food, its much more practical and I can eat different things every day.
Who didnt feel bad right?, I believe I felt bad many days, but I learned to deal with this feeling and see the good side of things.
Social distancing is something very cruel analyzing closely, because we cant hug or kiss those we like, we cant go to parties and as soon as we leave the house, its very sad.
I do this every morning when I run in my neighborhood, its very refreshing and I can spend the rest of the day in a good mood because of it.
