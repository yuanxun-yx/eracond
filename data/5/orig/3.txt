I prefer dont do it, cause is not safe.
I work online so, I use my time wisely and in the other hand is good time to share with family, cause usual you know, we need go to work and theres no much time to spare.
I agree, is for us and our family safety, many people are too gridy so they dont care about others, even his own family...
I think is better, cause I have the time to prepare more elaborated food and so more time to delight than usual.
Never, my only worry sometimes is to have no more work.
Really, really hard as you said with the family first and with the close friends, I have not see my friends since one and a half year ago.
Thats sounds great, maybe I try someday, cause I have more time as I said before.
