Hi! I had to postpone my trip to the US three times since the pandemic started...
I usually watch Netflix, I love real crime docuseries, or play games like animal crossing on my nintendo switch.
Shopping online is great! Before the pandemic I was already adept to shopping online and now is all i do. the only downside is having to wait until the product arrives =(
Not really. My diet changed because my husband and I went to see a nutritionist, he wanted to loose weight, I wanted to gain. 
Actually, Ive been feeling really good! I started seeing a therapist and taking medicine for my anxiety and having my husband around all the time actually made our relationshio even stronger.
Very hard, I like to hug the people I love!
I go on walks with my husband so we can talk and get out for a while.
