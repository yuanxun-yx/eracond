Yeah, I was not able to travel too. 
To fill my time while staying at home, I often play video games or tend my garden.
Yeah, I believe its safer shopping online, this reduces the possibility of me being infected with COVID-19.
My diet has been more of a variety. Sometimes, I go vegetarian, other times I prefer meat.
Its normal to feel down during the quarantine especially if one is alone. Luckily for me, I didnt ever feel down as I had my family around to spend time with.
I think social distancing is a necessary activity to combat the spread of COVID-19. I dont think its hard to practice. We just need to get used to the fact that some of these changes are necessary.
Thankfully, I do unplug from technology from time to time to tend to my garden. I agree spending time outdoors is necessary for physical and mental health. I often enjoy taking a walk in the morning.
