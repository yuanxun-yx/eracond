I had to stop traveling because of corona virus in 2020
I have been working from home since 2020, I work longer hours now but I also like to read and browse the web
I do shop online more but I had been doing it since before covid so that didnt change much for me. I support masks but not gloves. Mask need to be n95 though
of course it has changed, we eat are home more now so we dont have that many choices and sometimes we are not sure what to eat or have for dinner any more, we need new recipes.
yes, I feel sad about all this but it is not that hard for me. Im an introvert so I dont really like people that much
I do feel like social distancing is necessary, I live in a huge city so there is always a lot of people nearby and many of them are not vaccinated. One cannot risk it
yes you are right, I havent been exercising much since covid started, however, I now do lots of house chores, I have to wash the dishes, clean the house, wash clothes, cook, so its not like Im not doing nothing
