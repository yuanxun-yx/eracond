Yes, youre right, but Im not really into travelling because I study in university and I dont have much time to spend for holidays
I usually study for my exams, watch Youtube videos and I usually practice my coding skills
Yes I love online shopping its really convenient and noadays, with Amazon Prime we have almost instantaneous delivery
Yes it has changed, I try to keep a healtier lifestyle and also eat more vegetables and fruit, that are necessary for our bodies
Were not in quarantine anymore but when we first ran into quarantine I felt really sad and depressed cause I had to give up all my daily tasks, such as school and other stuff
Yes it is really difficult and challenging
Yes, I completely agree, in fact I often walk in the park near my university
