I wish I could go to europe, but with the corona virus I can leave my country
When the corona virus first started I stayed at home and try learning to play guitar. Now playing guitar is my new hobby
I think everyone should shop online nowdays because there is no reason not to, it is so quick and easy. I shop online all the time!
To be honest my diet changed for the worse after now that I been in quarantine. I am not much of a cook so I mostly eat frozen food and noodles.
Absolutely. Sometimes I feel down because I dont have anyone to talk to and cant see my friends and my family in person. Theres just somethinf about having someones company in person that just makes me feel better.
It is definetly hard to practice social distancing because human beings are made for human touch and afectuation. So to be robbed of that because of the virus is very hard.
Well, I will be sure to try that. I usually do go outside, but I think it would be good for me to be in touch with nature.
