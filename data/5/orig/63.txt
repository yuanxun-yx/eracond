Hi there. Yes, my travels have been limited, especially in the last year, because of the covid
When I stay home I like to try new recipes. To do sports and watch as many movies as possible.
Yes, my online shopping has increased since the covid appeared. This way I can avoid congestion.
Yes, it has definitely changed for the better. I eat much healthier
I had some moments but they passed. The hardest part was when I couldnt visit my loved ones.
Yes, social distance has had a pretty negative impact on me. But Im working on it to look at things with more confidence
Sounds good. I will definitely follow your advice. They seem to help.
