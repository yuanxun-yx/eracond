Well right now there arent many restrictions
Haha, for example trying to make some money online, monetize my free time
With the masks they should be more or less safe right now.
I think Im using more home-delivery services now.
Yea, quarantine is horrible, thank God this is over!
Up to a point, you can get used to it, but after some weeks it gets really tough.
I dont see how that is related to Covid  or lockdowns?
