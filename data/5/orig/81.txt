I am stuck at my city since the beginning of the pandemic.
Currently just wrking remotely. At the beginning I tried to do some work around the house, but it all went bad.
My online shopping habits are the same,  I think, before the corona virus I was shopping online almost the same.
Why are you sorry? Our diets have changed a lot, especially because the price of the aliments have increased a lot. Meat for example, almost double that it was before.
Yes, sometimes I wish to go outside and eat something differente, drink a beer at a bar, or just browse stuff at the mall. 
Very difficult, but right now it is necessary. And I think this is the new normal.
It will be nice, but with home working it is more difficult by the day. Also, the house needs more care with everyone on it all the time. I spend a lot of time just cleaning.
