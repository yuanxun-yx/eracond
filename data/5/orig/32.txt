That is true for me too, I dont travel much anyway but would like to visit my brother but am hesitant to do so.
Reading books and manga, watching anime, writing stories and programming mostly
Online shopping is very convenient and especially good for a pandemic but sometimes shopping in person is necessary.
Mine hasnt changed much, but yes unless I am ordering Hello Fresh it is not very diverse.
Not more than usual I would say. I guess it does cause negative feeling but usually doesnt lower my general mood
Yeah once you sit together it is hard to keep to the rules
Well sadly it is winter by now, but I should spent more time outside anyway I suppose.
