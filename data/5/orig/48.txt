Hello, nice talking to you too. I heard the same.
I like to read and watch movies and TV, but while in confinement I did try to pick up new skills.
I dont think theres too much of a problem going outside, if youre careful to keep safe with masks and hand sanitizer. And of course, getting the vaccine.
Only in asmuch as Ive started stress eating a couple of times.
I did, lots of times. 
I agree, its very hard. I miss hugging my friends.
Sure. As long as you take your mask
