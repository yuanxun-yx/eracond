I agree, my last trip was cancelled because of COVID
I play videogames and I watch TV
I prefer online shopping as I live in a smal town so yeah
Yes, I have more time to took but its not that easy to find new meals each day
It wasnt easy all the times. I really missed having a good beer in a pub during these days
Its quite easy towards colleagues but really difficult with my familly
We had an awful summer here so I didnt go outside that much.
