Hello , thanks for asking. Basiclly i never really travelled before but that corona virus dont really affect my life , i can travals anywhere (or almost) i want now.
I start to read books about self improvements , cooking , programming skills , cryptoccurencies , Mturk , Some exercise , better diet and helping people i love
I think Masks and gloves is a safe way to have contacts with people in case of a contaminations like these days
My diet is way more better than before , i started eating a lot of vegetables that i grow myself , but yeah people are getting less lazier as they dont have anything to do during quarantine
I felt quite down during quarantine but you get used to it and found new ways to be happy , you could always socialize online with internet and makke new friends around the world and pass the time with them
its not hard to rpactice , its self discipline and a lot of values dont have these values
ill try to do that the next few months , socialize and get new good friends to grow my economics and buisinesses
