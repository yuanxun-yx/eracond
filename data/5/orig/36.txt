Yes, I have been stuck in my house for over two years now
I mostly play games and watch TV. I also work from home so thats a plus. Ive been trying to study programming, but I havent had much success
I think as long as you take the proper precautions then it should be fine. But yes, isolation is better
Yes I agree, Ive been cooking more at home, before I always used to order out
Sometimes yes, but Im staying with awesome people so that helps take the edge off of quarantine
Well its very hard in tight places. But if its family then it should be allright
Id like to, but where I live theres not much nature. I do unplug from technology sometimes
